    <p>Joseph Fetsch has no hobbies. In his spare time, he studies. On bus rides with the band, he does homework.</p>

<p>Afterward, he goes home, sleeps for four-six hours and does it again.</p>

<p>His schedule leaves no spare time. Fetsch, 47, is a full-time student, instructor and member of the Auburn University Marching Band.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>His days consist of four upper-level accounting courses, teaching two classes on aviation management and playing trumpet in the band.</p>

<p>Fetsch said he wanted to join the marching band ever since he stood in the end zone at Jordan-Hare Stadium during a game for ROTC duty.</p>

<p>“I got to see the band go, and that whole performance was really overwhelming,” Fetsch said. “I decided if I ever was a full-time student, I would live that chance.”</p>

<p>The game was a different experience for Fetsch, who originally graduated from a private university, Clarkson University, in New York.</p>

<p>The small, upstate college didn’t even have a football team.</p>

<p>“We just never experienced anything like being in Jordan-Hare,” Fetsch said. “My first year at Auburn was the undefeated national championship season, so that probably helped.”</p>

<p>He said he likes the band specifically, his fellow trumpet players, who earned the dubious honor of “Most Egotistical Section” at last year’s band banquet.</p>

<p>“If you’re good, there’s nothing wrong with knowing you’re good,” Fetsch said.</p>

<p>He said band life is enjoyable despite the weird relationship and age gap between him and the average marcher.</p>

<p>He said he prefers to avoid the band’s extracurricular activities and declines invitations to parties. Fetsch attended one once, but left early.</p>

<p>“It was more fun without me there,” Fetsch said. “Besides, I’ve had more fun than they’re ever going to have.”</p>

<p>Fetsch had his fun in the Air Force, whose members enjoy his practical jokes and tomfoolery.</p>

<p>“We call them spirit missions,” said retired Major Dale Lightfoot, who worked with Fetsch in the Auburn ROTC program. “It’s a culture in the Air Force.”</p>

<p>When a superior officer complained about trucks blocking his parking space, Fetsch acted.</p>

<p>“I took a 10,000-pound all-terrain forklift, went over to his car, picked it up, took it over to the loading docks and put it between these two ramps,” Fetsch said.</p>

<p>The superior officer’s Honda Civic was stuck between the ramps, bumper-to-bumper, impossible to move.</p>

<p>“I thought it was really funny,” Fetsch said.</p>

<p>Last April, when his children, Mike, 16, and Karen, 12, returned home from school, Fetsch directed them to “brownies” in the kitchen.</p>

<p>They left disappointed, finding only a foil-wrapped plate of brown-colored capital letter “E”, or brown-E’s.</p>

<p>Fetsch was known for his sense of humor when he served as commander of the Auburn Air Force ROTC Detachment.</p>

<p>When he would announcegood news or scholarships, the colonel favored a red-and-white Santa Claus hat.</p>

<p>Fetsch worked hard at the job though, sometimes staying on duty for 12 hours per day.</p>

<p>Lightfoot called him an absolute perfectionist, someone who drove himself and the Air Force ROTC cadets to give their best effort in every activity.</p>

<p>“He was really passionate about taking care of the students,” Lightfoot said. “He was just a big cheerleader and fan for them.”</p>

<p>Fetsch could be competitive at times, according to Lightfoot.</p>

<p>In 2011, Auburn held the Gamma Cup, a competition among Air Force ROTC detachments from schools including Clemson, Alabama and Tennessee.</p>

<p>When the organizers put together a flag football game for the senior staff members, the colonel played receiver intensely.</p>

<p>“Colonel Fetsch, for being in his mid-40s, was doing these crazy routes every time,” Lightfoot said.</p>

<p>Fetsch retired on Oct. 31, 2012, to avoid a transfer to South Korea.</p>

<p>“It just got to the point where that was too much family sacrifice to do,” Fetsch said.</p>

<p>He enrolled at Auburn to study accounting in spring 2013.</p>

<p>Fetsch said he hoped to become a certified public accountant specializing in tax work.</p>

<p>The father of three juggles his other commitments with classwork and trying to maintain his 4.0 GPA.</p>

<p>Jefferson Jones, associate professor of accounting and one of Fetch’s professors, spoke highly of Fetsch’s academic abilities.</p>

<p>“Always prepared; always gave great effort,” Jones said. “I could not have asked for anybody to be more conscientious.”</p>

<p>Fetsch said accounting appeals to him because he can take it at half speed, a happy prospect after 25 years of military service.</p>

<p>“Now what I want back is time,” Fetsch said. “Time is the most valuable resource.”</p>

<p>He said he also wants to spend more time doing something good to make a difference, and spend more time with his family.</p>

<p>His first step? Buying football tickets for them to come see him march every Saturday.</p>
