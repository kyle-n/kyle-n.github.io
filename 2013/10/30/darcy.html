    <p>On May 11, 2013, Darcy Corbitt was born at 21 years of age.</p>

<p>With her friends gone for the summer, Corbitt moved a couch, three bookshelves and more than 350 books into an apartment to start her new life.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>She had $70 in her checking account. It was the day before her birthday.</p>

<p>The Auburn University senior no longer wanted to go by her birth name, David Hall. She wanted to start again as Darcy.</p>

<p>“When I was really little, 3, 4, I thought I was a girl,” Corbitt said. “I went by a girl’s name in my mind, but I never told anyone because I knew it was socially unacceptable.”</p>

<p>Corbitt struggled with such feelings throughout her childhood and said despite being born biologically male, she never felt like a man.</p>

<p>“I tried to be that person for 18 years and it didn’t fit me,” Corbitt said.</p>

<p>With help from her friends, she began exploring the idea of living as a woman.</p>

<p>Bonnie Wilson in the Women’s Initiatives Office said she recalled a poignant conversation about gender identity with Corbitt when she still went by David.</p>

<p>“I asked her, ‘if there weren’t any barriers, what would you be?’” Wilson said. “And (Corbitt) said, ‘a woman.’ And I said, ‘then that’s what you are.’”</p>

<p><span class="quote">“My whole life, all the decisions I’ve ever made, I’ve made for love.”</span></p>

<p>Corbitt said she also credits Spectrum, Auburn’s Gay-Straight Alliance, with helping her come to understand her identity.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t have the GSA, I don’t know what I would have done,” Corbitt said. “I’d have probably killed myself.”</p>

<p>When she still used the name David, Corbitt said she came within seconds of committing suicide after being outed as someone attracted to men.</p>

<p>“The only thing stopping me was I couldn’t break the razor blade out of my razor,” Corbitt said.</p>

<p>“I just kind of thought that was funny. I laughed, and I thought, ‘I can’t really kill myself. I’ve got so much I can do in the world.’”</p>

<p>Corbitt fully accepted being Darcy last May, on her 21st birthday.</p>

<p>The transition hasn’t been easy. Some friends offered minimal support for her new public identity.</p>

<p>Corbitt said her best friend from high school, a girl who drove three hours from the University of Montevallo to see her during their freshman year, unfriended her on Facebook last summer.</p>

<p>“You post a lot of gay stuff,” Corbitt said the friend told her.</p>

<p>Corbitt said she recently ran into her former best friend. When Corbitt tried to start a conversation, the friend showed little pleasure in seeing her.</p>

<p>Other groups have reacted differently to the news.</p>

<p>Corbitt sent an email to every professor she’s worked with in the past to let them know about the change.</p>

<p>The faculty responded with immediate and overwhelming support.</p>

<p>“The University was really classy about it,” Corbitt said.</p>

<p>Today, Corbitt said she embraces her identity as a woman. She dresses in a women’s suit with thick-frame glasses, a red-and-orange scarf and a purple shirt to match her purple wristwatch.</p>

<p>Silver eye shadow and lipstick adorn her face. Her fingernails bear pink Ballet Slippers nail polish, which she said she fidgets with when nervous.</p>

<p>Her friends admire the change, citing its positive effects.</p>

<p>“I saw how it truly made her happy to do that,” said Alyssa Patterson, a junior who shared English classes with Corbitt. “She’s so much more confident in who she is.”</p>

<p>In conversation, Corbitt appears confident. She laughs easily and jokes about blasting “Dancing Queen” by ABBA, her favorite song, at annoying neighbors.</p>

<p>In her new life, the senior majoring in English and psychology serves as director of social affairs for Spectrum, an advocacy group for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender (LBGT) students.</p>

<p>Corbitt said she hopes to attend graduate school to become a therapist for LBGT teens.</p>

<p>Her friends spoke highly of her academic work.</p>

<p>“She’s a good G–d— student,” said Kelly Tsaltas, senior in psychology.</p>

<p>Corbitt’s peers said they also admire her intelligence.</p>

<p>“She’s really smart and cognizant in how people think and feel and express themselves,” Wilson said.</p>

<p>Corbitt said she would prefer to remain at Auburn for graduate school, but thinks she’ll probably attend another institution.</p>

<p>Until she leaves, she also wants to stay close to her parents. They declined to comment for this story.</p>

<p>Corbitt said she understands her transition has been difficult for her mother and father, but she would have been unhappy any other way.</p>

<p>“My whole life, all the decisions I’ve ever made, I’ve made for love,” Corbitt said. “I came out for myself, the second time because I wanted to be happy.”</p>
