title: About this website
---

I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an amazing static site generator and blogging tool. I would recommend it for technically inclined writers. Once you've navigated the setup and learning curve, you can produce content quickly in any Markdown editor. 

I designed my website to use static pages and minimal assets because this website is text, images and video and doesn't need much more. I wish more news sites approached site design like this ([besides Vox Media](https://product.voxmedia.com/2014/7/29/5863004/take-a-peek-at-the-code-that-powered-the-verge-50)). Keeping pages light is vital in a world where most readers are on underpowered smartphones. [More on static websites and why they're important.]({% post_url 2015-08-05-ssgSetup %})

*Side note: The site is a bit plain at the moment because I am rebuilding the CSS from scratch. Jekyll's prebuilt CSS was too heavy. You'll have to excuse the aesthetics. While I am a good writer, I am not the greatest artist.*

Thanks also to GitHub for [hosting my site](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free. Much obliged for the server space and helpful setup guides. 

Posts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), the absolute easiest way to produce content HTML-formatted content for the web. Thank you, [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Related posts are created through a [homemade algorithm](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io/blob/master/_includes/related_posts.html) that does a deep dive on every tag. It slows down site build time prodigiously, but hey, it's a static site generator so the build speed doesn't affect the end user. Also GitHub gets to bear that cost so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

If your browser extensions mention a tracker, that's Google Analytics. Don't worry about it, it's just to see how many people are interested in reading my work.
