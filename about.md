title: About this website
---

I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an amazing static site generator and blogging tool. I would highly recommend it for technically inclined writers. It takes a ton of work to set up and learn to use, but once ready it's amazing. 

I designed my website to use static pages and minimal assets because that's how websites in the 21st century should work. Keeping pages light is vital in a world where most readers are on underpowered smartphones. [More on static websites and why they're important.]({% post_url 2015-08-05-ssgSetup %})

*Side note: This is why the site is a bit plain at the moment. Jekyll's prebuilt CSS was too heavy. I tore it all out and am rebuilding from scratch. You'll have to excuse the style. While I am a good writer, I am not the greatest artist. I'm also trying to keep the pages loading quickly. No point using a static site generator if you have 10 `<script>` tags in the top.*

Thanks also to GitHub for [hosting my site](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free. Much obliged for the server space and helpful setup guides. 

Posts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), the absolute easiest way to produce content HTML-formatted content for the web. 

Related posts are created through a [homemade algorithm](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io/blob/master/_includes/related_posts.html) that does a deep dive on every tag. It slows down site build time prodigiously, but hey, it's a static site generator so the build speed doesn't affect the end user.
