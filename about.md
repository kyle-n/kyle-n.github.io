title: About this website

I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an amazing static site generator and blogging tool. I would highly recommend it for technically inclined writers. It takes a ton of work to set up and learn to use, but once ready it's amazing. 

I designed my website to use static pages and minimal assets because that's how websites in 2015 should work. Keeping pages light is vital in a world where most readers are on underpowered smartphones. [More on static websites and why they're important.]({% post_url 2015-08-05-ssgSetup %})

Thanks also to GitHub for [hosting my site](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free. Much obliged for the server space and helpful setup guides. 

All CSS fading effects are done through [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/), a very helpful and easy-to-use tool. 

Posts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), the absolute easiest way to produce content HTML-formatted content for the web. 

Related posts are created through a [homemade algorithm](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io/blob/master/_includes/related_posts.html) that does a deep dive on every tag. It slows down site build time prodigiously, but hey, it's a static site generator so the build speed doesn't affect the end user. Besides, it's plenty fast when GitHub servers are doing the work.

Google Analytics. Don't worry about it, it's just to see how many people are interested in reading my work.
