title: About this website
---

I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a useful static site generator and blogging tool. For read-only sites with few technical requirements and infrequent updates, a static site generator is ideal. 

Thanks to GitHub for [hosting my site](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free. Much obliged for the server space and helpful setup guides. 

Posts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), the absolute easiest way to produce content HTML-formatted content for the web. Thank you, [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Related posts are created through a [homemade algorithm](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io/blob/master/_includes/related_posts.html) that does a deep dive on every tag. It slows down site build time prodigiously, but hey, the end user isn't affected and the site updates infrequently. Also GitHub gets to bear that cost so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

If your browser extensions mention a tracker, that's Google Analytics. Don't worry about it, it's just to see how many people are interested in my work.
