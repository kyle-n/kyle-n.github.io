During a visit to San Francisco last February, I rode in a Waymo and [was amazed](/blog/waymo-pedestrian-safety) at how safely it drove. During our trip, it stopped for three separate pedestrians when crossing an intersection.

> As a pedestrian who cares about traffic safety, I _loved_ this. A human driver would never have yielded to three pedestrians. A human would've gunned it and dared that third guy to cross in front of him. That's standard behavior for drivers in America, and it's why drivers killed [7,522 pedestrians in 2022 alone](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/pedestrians). The Waymo actually _followed the law_. It didn't even speed!

> Say what you will about self-driving cars, but what Waymo has on the roads of San Francisco is _better_ that most humans.

Well, now Waymo has data backing up this impression. The _New York Times_ has an [essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/02/opinion/self-driving-cars.html) from a neurosurgeon advocating for wider self-driving adoption:

> Self-driving car company Waymo recently [released](https://waymo.com/safety/impact/) data covering nearly 100 million driverless miles in four American cities through June 2025, the biggest trove of information released so far about safety. I spent weeks analyzing the data. The results were impressive. When compared to human drivers on the same roads, Waymo’s self-driving cars were involved in 91 percent fewer serious-injury-or-worse crashes and 80 percent fewer crashes causing any injury. It showed a 96 percent lower rate of injury-causing crashes at intersections.

The author mentions one thing some drivers dislike about Waymos:

> There’s a common misconception that these cars brake erratically and get rear-ended. But they are involved in far fewer rear-end injury crashes than human drivers are.

I can see why some drivers feel Waymos are "erratic." They brake differently than humans, in that they actually brake.
