I love [Blank Check with Griffin & David](https://www.blankcheckpod.com). It's a wonderful film podcast hosted by an actor/comedian and the film critic for [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com). I've been a loyal listener since 2017 for almost all their nearly 10-year run.

Picking an episode can be difficult with so large a back catalog. I would recommend any episode about a movie you've seen. Otherwise, please use this list I recently made for a friend getting into the show.

**[_A Master Builder_ with John Hodgman](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/A_Master_Builder)**: Perhaps their silliest and finest episode yet. A wall-to-wall riot about a film that does not exist.

**[_Speed Racer_ with J.D. Amato and Emily Yoshida](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Speed_Racer)**: A phenomenal defense of the Wachowski sisters' underrated, bizarre live-action _Speed Racer_. J.D.'s story about seeing it in theaters is so good it has [its own YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9QLpY4CyM&t=2s).

**[_The Matrix Reloaded_](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/The_Matrix_Reloaded)**: No one has ever given a defense of the Matrix sequels as well as David Sims. Seraph is a login screen.

**[_Spirited Away_ with David Rees](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Spirited_Away)**: A serious episode about one of the ten greatest films ever made. I would never have believed a story involving _The Financial Times_ could be so moving.

**[_Paprika_ with Emily Yoshida](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Paprika)**: A wonderful, deep conversation about the nature of dreams and film.

**[_Big Trouble in Little China_ with Jason Mantzoukas and Paul Scheer](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Trouble_in_Little_China)**: Come for the great comedian guests, stay for the in-depth analysis of Hollywood leading men.

**[_Don Jon_ with Hollywood Handbook](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Don_Jon)**: A funny episode trying to make sense of an incomprehensible passion project.

**[_Treasure Planet_ with Emma Stefansky](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Treasure_Planet)**: At one point, Stefansky claims to know the movie word-for-word. When challenged, she immediately recites the first 10 lines or so of _Treasure Planet_. That's how much love this episode has for a great film.

**[_Welcome to Marwen_ with Emily Yoshida](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Welcome_to_Marwen)**: A hilarious exploration of a bizarre movie.

**[_The Holiday_ with Fran Hoepfner](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/The_Holiday)**: Nancy Meyers is a genius and unsung auteur. Unfortunately, she also made _The Holiday_.

**[_Assassin's Creed_](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed)**: Blank Check has a producer, [Ben Hosley](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Ben_Hosley). He really loves the 2016 _Assassin's Creed_ movie.

**[_Aquaman_](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Aquaman)**: A long and humorous exploration of the DC Extended Universe. Also, sea crime.

**[_Home Again_ with Richard Lawson](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Home_Again)**: A classic episode covering what the show terms "gas leak cinema" - movies that only make sense if there has been a gas leak.

**[_Robocop_](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/RoboCop)**: If you want to listen to two and a half hours of Griffin Newman explaining why Robocop is the American Jesus, this is it!

**[_Inception_](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Inception)**: An extremely silly episode in which they must enter "a podcast within a podcast" multiple times.

**[_Clifford_](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Clifford)**: Another Producer Ben's Choice about a disconcerting Martin Short comedy.

**[_Aloha_ with Ester Zuckerman](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Aloha)**: Cameron Crowe used to be a great director of rom-coms and dramas. But what if he made a movie about _the sky_?!

**[_War Horse_ with Pilot Viruet](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/War_Horse)**: The phrase "Steven Spielburg's War Goose" will live rent-free in my head forever.

**[_Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk_ with J.D. Amato](https://blank-check.fandom.com/wiki/Billy_Lynn%27s_Long_Halftime_Walk)**: This episode contains the comedy equivalent of a basketball player draining a shot from across the court. An all-time bit.
