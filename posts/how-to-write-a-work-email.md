Some people suck at writing work emails. They meander. They equivocate. They provide too little or too much context. They don't _get to the point_.

As a disgraced former journalist, I know some tricks.

Most important: everyone's busy. People don't read, they scan. Long or confusing messages get skipped.

When writing a work email, **put the topic in the first sentence**. Background can wait. Make sure the recipient immediately knows why you're in their inbox. Then explain why.

Second, **make it brief**. In journalism school, one of my professors made us memorize this passage from [_The Elements of Style_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White [^1]:

[^1]: The same [E. B. White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._B._White) who wrote _Charlotte's Web_ and _Stuart Little_!

> Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

If you can ask a question in one sentence, do so. If you can provide an update without extraneous details, do so.

However! Include necessary context in your email. For example, a bug report sent to your product owner should include who reported the bug, the impact, and possibilities for fixing it. Simply writing "The invoice syncing mechanism is broken" requires them to write you for more information. Don't waste their time.

I recommend writing this way for two reasons. One, your coworkers will reply to your emails sooner and with more helpful information. Short, clear emails are easier to handle. Two, your coworkers will appreciate your respect for their time.
