Fast forward to 2025, and [here we are](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels):

I'm excited to see what other developers do with a free on-device LLM. I won't use it, though. 2023 me wanted it for my web extension to autofill login codes from your email inbox. Alas, Apple [built that first](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/you-can-now-autofill-email-verification-codes-on-ios-17/).
