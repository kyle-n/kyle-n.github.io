A month and a half ago, I [wrote](/blog/carp-science-funding) about my spouse's lab running out of funding while agonizingly close to a viable solution for wiping out invasive common carp.

> When my spouse signed onto this project in spring 2024, it was funded by that consortium of states, with the promise of more later from the federal government. Unfortunately, [things changed](https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-trump-and-kennedy-are-destroying-global-science-even-einstein-questioned-facts-but-theres-a-method-to-it-261568). Federal funding is difficult to find in 2025.

> This is tremendously frustrating. The project is not done. Even though they’ve figured out how to make YY supermales, there are a dozen more things to do. Somebody’s got to raise large numbers of supermales and distribute them to rivers and lakes around the country. One of the drugs involved requires FDA approval. Hell, the supermales are actually just the start. The real trick, apparently, is YY _superfemales_. Make those, and an invasive species is as good as gone.

I am happy to report that the problem has been solved, at least for the moment. Their lab went back to the initial funders, who provided enough money to keep the project running until December 2026. I'm thrilled my spouse will be able to continue this vital work.
