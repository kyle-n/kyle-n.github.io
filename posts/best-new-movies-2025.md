2025 was not great for movies. The [strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hollywood_labor_disputes) left little in the pipeline. What did come out was decent. Not great. But let's celebrate the good stuff anyway.

**Note**: This year's list skews heavily toward horror and thrillers. Watch trailers at your discretion.

### _Weapons_

<YoutubeEmbed id="OpThntO9ixc" />

_Weapons_ announced itself this April with [the creepiest teaser I have ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3qtHlROEuc). In just 44 seconds, it tells you two things. One, the movie is about a town where a bunch of kids run out of their houses into the night, never to be seen again. Two, _holy shit_.

_Weapons_ is a superb horror movie and something stranger. Without spoilers, director Zach Creggar has a couple obvious metaphors and some less obvious ones. _Weapons_ is proudly weird. It focuses on surprising subjects. It's funnier than I expected.

Creggar's last movie, _Barbarian_, was a pure scarefest with Swiss-watch timing. _Weapons_ shows him growing as an artist - exploring new themes, tones and techniques, all without losing the audience.

The more _Weapons_ has sat with me, the more I like it. Another tremendous film from one of the best young horror directors working today.

### _Superman_

<YoutubeEmbed id="Ox8ZLF6cGM0" />

James Gunn is getting soft, in the best possible way. The cynical edgelord who used to churn out [shock-a-minute schlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tromeo_and_Juliet) for Troma has become open-hearted and sentimental in his older age. Just look at _Guardians of the Galaxy_, a loving tribute to found families and second chances.

With 2025's _Superman_, Gunn has reimagined the Man of Steel as many in Hollywood dare not - a hero. Gunn's Superman believes in Truth, Justice, and the American Way. He's so earnest, other characters can't help but dunk on him. And yet, the film is on his side. It believes there is nothing more radical than sincerity. It literally states being a nice guy is punk rock.

That's what I want from Superman. I want a guy who believes in something. A guy who believes in _believing_.

### _It Was Just an Accident_

<YoutubeEmbed id="nF04v-ze2Yc" />

One day, an Iranian mechanic hears a noise. He hasn't heard the noise in years, but it haunts his dreams. He thinks it's the odd squeak of the false leg belonging to a government intelligence officer who tortured him. So he impulsively kidnaps him. There's just one problem - he's not sure the guy tied up in the back of his van is the right one.

_It Was Just an Accident_ is a powerful study in human response to trauma. As the mechanic finds other victims of the torturer (hoping one can identify him), they react with forgiveness, avoidance, rage and more. There's no right way to handle a man who's committed an unforgiveable crime against you.

The ending is unforgettable. Some of the most riveting dialogue you'll see in a movie this year.

### _Wake Up Dead Man_

<YoutubeEmbed id="0hc8yz5-d5Y" />

Rian Johnson's gifted us another fantastic Benoit Blanc mystery for Christmas. This time, a priest has been killed inside a small room when no one was near him. It is, as Daniel Craig says in his delightful Foghorn Leghorn accent, a "perfect crime."

The mystery isn't even the best part. Johnson uses its setting in an old Catholic parish to explore religion - what it is, what it isn't, and what it can be.

Every actor in _Wake Up Dead Man_ is good, but I must give special mention to Josh O'Connor as the young priest. He killed it [last year](/blog/best-new-movies-2024) in _Challengers_, and he's even better here.

One of O'Connor's scenes sticks with me even now. He's on the phone with a secretary trying to get an essential clue, but she keeps getting sidetracked. You can see him get more and more frustrated, until the secretary tells him her mother's dying. They fought in their last conversation, and she's afraid it'll be the last thing she ever said to her. Could the father pray with her?

The way O'Connor's body _deflates_ at this is phenomenal. All his frustration falls away as he remembers he is a priest. This woman is not just a clue-giver. She's going through one of the most important times in her life, and he needs to be there for her. To Rian Johnson, there is no higher or nobler purpose for religion.

### _28 Years Later_

<YoutubeEmbed id="mcvLKldPM08" />

In 2002, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland reinvigorated the zombie movie with _28 Days Later_. They leaned into fears of terrorism, disease and civil unrest to make a supremely stressful tale set in the immediate aftermath of England's zombie apocalypse. It was quite post-9/11.

Now, 23 years later, they have re-teamed to show us how it's done. _28 Years Later_ is set decades after the fall of England. The survivors have created new societies through careful scavenging and avoiding the infected at all costs.

It's been so long, in fact, that the hero of the movie is a teenage boy with no memory of the before times. He's only ever known this, a world without electricity or safety. But events conspire to push him out of the settlement and into the remnants of England, which are stranger and more dangerous than he knows.

_28 Years Later_ is a good zombie movie, but the thing that has stuck with me for months is Ralph Fiennes' performance as the "mad" doctor. He teaches the protagonist to remember we must die. _Memento mori_. It's unexpectedly profound.

### _One Battle After Another_

<YoutubeEmbed id="hg8AGTyYMBA" />

There's madness in this country. Different kinds, different amounts, but madness. Couldn't tell you why. Maybe it was [spending a year alone during COVID](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55879-9). Maybe it's fury at [certain people](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates/537909/). Maybe [Americans have always been like this](https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/).

Regardless, it feels like things got worse in the last few years. People [punching flight attendents](https://onlabor.org/air-rage-a-rising-threat-to-flight-attendants-physical-and-mental-health/), talking themselves into [taking horse dewormer](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ivermectin-and-covid-19) and [letting their children get sick with preventable diseases](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline). A large number of people in this country — a _significant_ number — do not exist in reality.

This year, three movies focused on American madness: _Bugonia_, _Eddington_ and _One Battle After Another_.

_One Battle After Another_ is the largest-scale look at the problem. It updates Thomas Pynchon's postmododern novel [_Vineland_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineland) to 2025 politics to depict a country deeply at war with itself, mired in self-loathing, fascistic rage.

But it's not hopeless. _One Battle_ believes in fighting. It knows you can't win everything today. You have to do your best and hope you didn't mess it up too badly for your kids.

### _No Other Choice_

<YoutubeEmbed id="HKZpuG_ezvY" />

Park Chan-wook is simply the best at unforgettable, so-dark-they're-funny films.

_No Other Choice_ follows a dad who's laid off from a paper plant. When applying for a new job, he has an idea. What if he kills every other candidate?

Things spiral from there. Park takes the audience on a wild ride about class, pride, masculinity and capitalism. I couldn't believe my eyes, but also? I get it.

### _Sinners_

<YoutubeEmbed id="bKGxHflevuk" />

_Sinners_ is unusual. On one hand, it's a crowd-pleasing horror movie about vampires. On the other, it's a historically accurate depiction of sharecropping and segregation. It is an incredibly specific story and vision, but it's also just entertaining. I'd recommend it to anyone with the stomach.

Director Ryan Coogler has a lot on his mind. What does it mean to be a man? How can you fight back against oppressive systems? What role should religion play in our lives?

I also must salute him for the single best [individual scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7jo5Cr6WUA) in a movie in 2025. I knew it was coming, and it still had me almost levitating in my chair.

### _Bugonia_

<YoutubeEmbed id="bd_5HcTujfc" />

Speaking of madness, Yorgos Lanthimos looked at today's craziness and had fun with it.

_Bugonia_ follows two guys who kidnap a female CEO and hold her hostage. Their theory is she is an alien, and responsible for everything that's gone wrong on Earth. They shaved her head so she couldn't communicate with her mothership.

Jesse Plemmons and Emma Stone are two of our finest living actors and great together. I also loved seeing comedian Stavros Halkias crush a couple scenes as an unhelpful cop.

_Bugonia_ is dark, nihilistic and funny. It's a nasty little parable about our times: exactly what I want from Yorgos.

### _The Naked Gun (2025)_

<YoutubeEmbed id="uLguU7WLreA" />

I've loved The Lonely Island's work for nearly 20 years. They have made three of the greatest comedies ever: _Hot Rod_, _MacGruber_ and _Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping_. Their movies are so deep in my brain, I still can't pick up a packet of green tea without muttering, ["I've been drinkin' green tea all god-damn day."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkvfiEO6bVU)

I'm in the bag for anything Akiva Schaeffer directs. Of course I loved _The Naked Gun_ (2025). It's packed with one-liners, sight gags, and even a _Mission: Impossible_ parody. Impossible to pick a favorite joke. "Me too!"? TiVo?? The snowman???

### The worst of the rest

This year, I've also decided to name and shame the 5 worst new movies, because screw them.

- _Captain America: Brave New World_: Ate too much homemade guac and fell asleep during the finale of this excruciatingly boring movie.
- _Honey Don't!_: A valid response to "Should I see this movie?".
- _A Minecraft Movie_: Best I can say is it got people into theaters.
- _Bring Her Back_: Boring, predictable and gross.
- _The Fantastic 4: First Steps_: Love the retro-futurist production design, hate everything else.
