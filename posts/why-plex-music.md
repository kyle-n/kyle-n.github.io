I've been a happy Spotify user for almost 14 years. But, this summer, I added music to my personal Plex server. This may seem odd, given I already pay for Spotify. However, Spotify doesn't have all the music I want.

Pitchfork's [2024 Album of the Year](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/best-albums-2024/) was 32 tracks of retro-style indie pop called [_Diamond Jubilee_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Jubilee_(album)>), by the Canadian band [Cindy Lee](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Lee_(band)>). The album isn't on Spotify or Apple Music! It's on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LJi5na897Y), [Bandcamp](https://cindylee.bandcamp.com/album/diamond-jubilee) and, amusingly, a free download from the artist's [personal GeoCities website](https://www.geocities.ws/ccqsk/). It's a superb piece of art - like the Nico tracks from The Velvet Underground came to life and had ennui.

I also wanted to give my partner a way to listen to some of their music. They spent their high school years digging through [The Metal Archives](https://www.metal-archives.com), soaking in obscure Finnish bands from the 2000s. My partner has a strong attachment to a couple bands so unknown, you can't buy their music anymore, let alone stream it on Spotify.

So, I added a new folder to my server's hard drive and started adding music. Plex automatically recognizes and organizes any files with reasonable mp3 tags. For Cindy Lee, I used the free download on the artist's website. For the metal bands, I found some decent YouTube copies and ripped them with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). Tagging was a cinch with [Mp3Tag](https://mp3tag.app).

Plex offers offline music playback through the [Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/) app. But, I found it ugly and not iOS-y enough. I prefer [Prism](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prism-music/id1335007451), which is a one-time $5 in-app purchase.

It's been a blast setting up my own music collection. When I add album art to mp3 files, it feels like I'm 15 and pirating songs for my iPod again. A delightful experience and easy way to enjoy music not on Spotify.
