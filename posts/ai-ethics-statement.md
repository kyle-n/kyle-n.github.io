I want readers to trust my blog. For transparency, AI is used for:

- Header art for some articles ([example](/blog/regular-and-dangerous-dysfunction)). AI art is captioned with the model and prompt used to produce it.
- The [code](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io) powering the site (I code with GitHub Copilot).

AI is _not_ used for any written content whatsoever. All thoughts published here are my own (and my fault). I do not use LLMs to generate ideas, create outlines, write, revise, or in any part of the writing process. It's the least I can do with my wildly useful [journalism degree](/blog/why-i-left-journalism).

I'm also moving away from using AI header art. It was a fun novelty, but I've grown frustrated with its inconsistency. I can get better results in less time with a little creativity. [This article](/blog/using-a-pc-from-the-keyboard), for example, uses a picture I took of my keyboard with a bunch of [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) filters on top. Looks way better than the AI keyboard art I tried to make at the time.
