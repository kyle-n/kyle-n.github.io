[Roger Corman died today](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/roger-corman-dead-independent-director-producer-king-of-the-b-1235896846/). I recommend his [obituary](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/roger-corman-dead-independent-director-producer-king-of-the-b-1235896846/) in _The Hollywood Reporter_, which is a fair and respectful overview of his life. Basically, Corman made a _lot_ of bad movies. He was polite, kind, and unpretentious. You can’t be when you’re producing [_Night of the Blood Beast_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Blood_Beast).

This poster rules, though.

If his movies look terrible, it’s because they are. They’re usually cheesy, cheap and exploitative.

I love these kinds of movies, though.

Terrible movies can surprise you. A bad enough film can almost feel like avante garde. Watch this scene from [_The Room_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room) and tell me the dialogue is not practically [Lynchian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch). It’s (unintentionally) grade-A surrealism.

One time, I was watching a Corman movie called [_Caged Heat_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071266/). It’s about a bunch of female prisoners fighting an evil doctor and warden. It’s pretty trashy.

_Caged Heat_ was directed by one of Corman’s protégés - a guy named [Jonathan Demme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Demme). He was working with a newbie cinematographer, [Tak Fujimoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tak_Fujimoto). You can tell it was Demme’s first directing job and Fujimoto’s third cinematography gig. The movie is bad, except for one insanely good shot where a person stares straight into the camera from an inch away.

_(I tried to find a screenshot of this, but I can't find remember which actor does it, and I don't want to watch the movie again. The [whole movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTedhTrzeNk) is on YouTube)._

Demme and Fujimoto parked the camera an inch from the actor’s face. They fill the screen, blasting you with the full power of their gaze. The effect is flooring.

You probably know this shot from the movie Demme and Fujimoto did 20 years later, a little film called [_The Silence of the Lambs_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_(film)>).

This is one of the scariest shots ever put in a movie. It makes me want to flee the country. It’s phenomenal.

NPR's culture critic Glen Weldon wrote a [wonderful obituary](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/525716786/jonathan-demme-and-the-simple-power-of-the-close-up) of Demme (who sadly predeceased his mentor, Corman) breaking down the power of the ultra close-up:

> The main reason Jonathan Demme's Oscar-winning 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs gets its hooks in you — and leaves you feeling vaguely distracted and discomfited long after it's over — isn't anything Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter says.
>
> It's how he says it. And to whom...
>
> Instead of having [his actors] pitch their performances slightly to camera left or camera right — a shot so ubiquitous to basic cinematic infrastructure that it barely registers with viewers — [Demme] has Hopkins stare down the barrel of the lens.
>
> Straight at us.
>
> Into us.

Seeing the ultra close-up in _Caged Heat_ makes the rest of that bad movie worth it. It’s neat to see Demme figure out the shot that’ll help him [win Best Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64th_Academy_Awards) someday. Seeing it in the middle of that pile of garbage redeems the rest of the movie. Well, almost. [^1]

[^1]: The ultra close-up lives on, by the way. [Barry Jenkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Jenkins), who Demme mentored, [used the shot to powerful effect](https://thefilmstage.com/cinematographer-james-laxton-on-capturing-the-romance-of-if-beale-street-could-talk-close-ups-and-errol-morris/) in [_If Beale Street Could Talk_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk_(film)>).

Bad movies are fun, because you never know what you'll find. Rest in peace, Roger Corman. Your movies were awful. We’ll miss you.
