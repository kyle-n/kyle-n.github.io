I'm a journalist with experience working on newspapers, magazines, and most of all, the web. I've worked as a reporter, writer, editor, copyeditor, video producer, photographer and web producer.

I currently work for the Ledger-Enquirer in Columbus, Ga., as a digital producer.

I specialize in producing longform features and telling traditional journalism in new and exciting ways online. The internet is the next great frontier in journalism, and I help news outlets expand in it.

I graduated from Auburn University with a bachelor's degree in journalism and computer science. I chose computer science as my minor to learn how to code and produce content for the Web. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Java and C++.

Before graduating, I was an editor for The Auburn Plainsman. I managed a team of writers while also contributing weekly features. One of the best was a [front-page feature]({% post_url 2013-10-30-darcy %}) on a transgender woman that was responsible for Auburn University adding gender identity as a protected class within university policy.

I also published a [three-month investigation]({% post_url 2015-03-17-snakes %}) into Auburn's development practices with respect to their environmental impact.
