I have several years of experience as a journalist at newspapers, magazines and the web. I've worked as a reporter, writer, editor, video producer, photographer and web producer.

My last journalism job is at the Atlanta-Journal Constitution as a producer. I wrote, edited and helped prepare content from the wire as well as create videos and sponsorship content. My work helped the AJC deliver unparalleled sponsorship packages. 

The work done by our group helped boost AJC traffic by millions of page views through unique distribution strategies and better SEO.
