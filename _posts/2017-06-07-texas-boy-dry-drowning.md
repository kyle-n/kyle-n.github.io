A four-year-old in Houston, Texas, died of “secondary drowning” almost a week after a family swimming trip, according to [KHOU](http://www.khou.com/news/local/family-warns-of-dry-drowning-after-son-dies-days-after-swimming/446413922).

Francisco Delgado Jr. [told KTRK](http://abc13.com/news/child-dies-after-swimming-at-texas-city-dike/2068971/) his family took a swim at the Texas City Dike with his son Francisco Delgado III (Frankie), 4, over Memorial Day weekend. Almost a week later, Frankie complained of shoulder pain and woke up a few hours later.

“Out of nowhere, he just woke up. He said ahhh,” Delgado told KTRK. “He took his last breath and I didn't know what to do no more.”  

Frankie passed away at East Houston Regional Hospital. 

Doctors told the family Frankie had fluid in his lungs and around his heart, a rare occurrence that affects mainly young children after they inhale water. 

According to [online guides](http://www.webmd.com/children/features/secondary-drowning-dry-drowning#1), secondary drowning symptoms include feeling extremely tired, having trouble breathing, chest pain and coughing. Parents who are afraid their child may be exhibiting symptoms of secondary drowning should get them a chest X-ray and an examination at a hospital. 

To prevent secondary drowning or dry drowning (when fluid causes the vocal cords to spasm and close), doctors recommend these water safety tips: 

- Watch your children closely around water
- Only let them swim in areas with lifeguards
- Never let your children swim alone
- Enroll them in water safety classes, if possible
- Fence off any pools you have at home

Kay Leaming-Van Zandt, an emergency medicine physician at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, warned KTRK that children can drown in “just inches of water.”

“It only takes a split second,” she said. “Drowning is silent. It’s not similar to what you see in the movies where there is a lot of commotion.” 

The Delgado family has set up a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/nbph8y-baby-frankies-funeral-expenses) to handle the unexpected funeral expenses. As of this writing they have raised $12,809 of their $20,000 goal.
