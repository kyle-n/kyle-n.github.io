About 18 hours after two men were shot, another man was killed Tuesday afternoon in second shooting in the same block of Cusseta Road, Columbus authorities said.

Marcus Bowden, 30, was pronounced dead at 12:35 p.m. at Midtown Medical Center, said Muscogee County Chief Deputy Coroner Freeman Worley. Columbus police said Bowden was taken to the hospital by ambulance after he was shot in the stomach around 11 a.m. His body will be sent to the crime lab for an autopsy.

Police are looking for an older model white Ford Explorer with dark tinted windows. Anyone with information is asked to call 706-653-3400.

The homicide came hours after two men were shot near the same house in the 2900 block of Cusseta Road, according to reports.

Police said two people were injured in a shooting around 6:15 p.m. Monday. One victim suffered from two gunshot wounds to the thigh and shin or calf, police said. The second victim had a gunshot wound to the back of the left thigh. Both were taken Midtown Medical Center and are listed in fair condition.

No description of a suspect was given and the shooting remains under investigation.

The report said it is unknown if the shootings are gang-related.

“We see a lot of drugs being sold on this corner,” said Willie Phillips, who works with Winterfield on the Move Against Drugs. “We have a gang problem. People continue to sell drugs. … (The police and mayor) could do more and they will do more.”

A man was also robbed at 7:46 p.m. in the 1900 block of Cusseta Road on the same day the two men were shot.

Columbus police said a robber pointed a pistol at the victim and told him to “give it up.” The report does not list what was taken.

Bowden is the 17th homicide in Columbus this year. His death follows the early Saturday shooting death of 23-year-old Christopher Twitty at his Wickham Drive home.
