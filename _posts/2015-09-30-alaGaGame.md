No. 8 Georgia and No. 13 Alabama are set to play each other today in Athens.

<!--break-->

The game starts today, Oct. 3, at 3:30 p.m. Eastern (2:30 p.m. Central) on CBS.

Georgia is coming off an easy 48-6 win against Southern last week. The defense limited Southern to 184 total yards, and only 10 first downs. Running back Nick Chubb rushed for more than 100 yards for a 12th straight game. He is now one 100-yard game away from breaking Herschel Walker’s school record.

On Alabama's side, the Crimson Tide is looking to prove that they're still a top-10 contender. A 14-0 lead at halftime in last week's game against Louisiana Monroe was nothing to write home about, but the Tide’s defense was fairly impressive in a 34-0 win. The defense racked up six sacks, had two interceptions and held ULM to 91 total yards (nine rushing yards). Alabama will need to find more offensive consistency if it hopes to get past Georgia.
