A Smiths Station High School graduate and former Columbus State student will perform on "America's Got Talent" tonight.

<!--break-->

Brittney Allen said her audition will be featured when the show airs at 8 p.m. Eastern on NBC.

"I really didn't think I was that interesting," Allen said. "I was really surprised when I got picked."

Allen said she performed her talent in front of the judges and more than a thousand people in the audience.

She can't say what her talent was or whether she passed before the show airs, but Allen said performing in front of so many people and TV cameras was nerve-wracking.

"I hardly remember anything from the audition," Allen said.

The Smiths Station graduate said she went to Columbus State University to study music for a semester. She dropped the major because she wanted to pursue music on her own terms.

Today Allen lives with her fianc√© Will Ortiz in Jacksonville. She said she misses Columbus and appreciates all the support her family and friends back home still give her.

Allen also said she hopes to continue her music career now that auditioning on "America's Got Talent" has helped force her out of her comfort zone.

"I hope this is my first step," Allen said. "I feel more open and confident."
