**Original Story**: A 19-year-old Columbus woman suffering from a gunshot wound died this morning at Midtown Medical Center, according to a post by Phenix City Police on their Facebook page.

Phenix City police said they received reports of shots fired in the 1000 block of 16th Street around 11:50 p.m. Sunday but did not find anyone when they arrived. They said they were notified by Columbus police "a short time later" that a woman had been driven to Midtown Medical Center while suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.

Hospital personnel were unable to revive 19-year-old Mariah Farrow, a 2015 graduate of Carver High School and current Columbus State University student. She was pronounced at 12:18 a.m., Russell County Coroner Arthur Sumbry Jr. said.

Her body will be transported to the Department of Forensic Sciences in Montgomery for an autopsy, according to the coroner.

Phenix City police said they are investigating the case and are "currently interviewing a number of witnesses."
