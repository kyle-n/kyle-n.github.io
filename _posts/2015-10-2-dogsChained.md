Two American bulldogs were brought to Animal Ark Rescue by Columbus Animal Care & Control yesterday in rough shape, according to a [post](https://www.facebook.com/118069674930375/photos/a.118483231555686.17028.118069674930375/911782775559057/?type=3&theater) by the Rescue on Facebook.

Animal control officers found the two chained together for "breeding purposes" when responding to a complaint in Columbus backyard, the post said. The heavy metal chain was padlocked and drawn so tightly, the Rescue wrote, that it embedded into the dogs' necks and caused painful injuries. The two had to be tranquilized and cut apart with bolt cutters.

The dogs are recovering at the Animal Ark Rescue according to Charlene Rallo, a full-time volunteer for the Rescue.

Rallo said these kinds of cases are sadly common. In her year working for the Rescue, she said she's seen four or five similar incidents.

It is unknown if Animal Care & Control plans to bring charges against the owner. They did not return multiple calls to their office for comment.

Rallo said the dogs are named Devin and Lacey. She guesses they are both 2-year-old American bulldogs. Devin was injured most and will take three to four weeks to recover. Even then, the damage will leave a mark until the hair grows back. Lacey should recover slightly faster in "a few weeks."

The Rescue staff plans to spay and neuter the dogs (as required by law) and  before putting them up for adoption, according to Rallo. There is already some interest in the dogs, as Rallo said some people have said they are mailing in donations.

"We just want to get them healthy," Rallo said. "(This case) seems to have touched quite a few people's hearts."
