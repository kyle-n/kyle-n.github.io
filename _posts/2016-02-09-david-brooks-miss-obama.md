David Brooks, in a [column](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/syndicated-columnists/article59342008.html) which has received a great deal of national attention:{% include footnote num="3" note="I wrote this link post because our sister site in Kansas City had Brooks' column and we did not. Wasn't on the national wires, for some reason." %}

> As this primary season has gone along, a strange sensation has come over me: I miss Barack Obama. Now obviously I disagree with a lot of Obama’s policy decisions. I’ve been disappointed by aspects of his presidency. I hope the next presidency is a philosophic departure.

> But over the course of this campaign it feels as if there’s been a decline in behavioral standards across the board. Many of the traits of character and leadership that Obama possesses, and that maybe we have taken too much for granted, have suddenly gone missing or are in short supply.

Brooks is a moderate Republican who writes for the New Yorks Times opinion page. His column has drawn partial praise from [Salon](http://www.salon.com/2016/02/09/we_wish_david_brooks_would_just_say_it_while_praising_obama_he_doesnt_put_blame_for_decline_in_civility_where_it_belongs_on_his_beloved_gop/), who wished he'd blamed Republican candidates' bad behavior more on the GOP.

[Vox](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/9/10950922/david-brooks-i-miss-obama) pointed out that Brooks and the Obamas have long been close, with Brooks enjoying a status as the White House's unofficial favorite columnist. Brooks is also famously [not fond of Ted Cruz](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/12/10756890/ted-cruz-david-brooks) or [Donald Trump](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/opinion/no-donald-trump-wont-win.html).
