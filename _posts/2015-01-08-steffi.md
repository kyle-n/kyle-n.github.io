Steffi Ledbetter, junior in theater, was featured in Thursday's, Jan. 8, episode of American Idol. Ledbetter performed a cover before judges Jennifer Lopez, Harry Connick Jr. and Keith Urban.

"When you're singing, it feels like it's inside of you," Lopez said to Ledbetter. "It's not coming out of you. Having said that, you are a really talented vocalist."

Lopez and Urban voted yes, sending her to compete in Hollywood at the next level of the competition.

"I really do believe I can do this," Ledbetter said. "I know I can. I really do... this means everything to me."
