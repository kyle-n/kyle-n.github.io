The man police say was shot early Thursday morning on 28th Avenue died Saturday at Midtown Medical Center, according to Muscogee County Coroner Buddy Bryan.

Simon Lee King Jr., 57, was pronounced dead at 2:20 p.m., Bryan said.

Witnesses told police King was walking down the street when a vehicle with two black men stopped next to him. After calling King over to the vehicle, they shot him, witnesses told police. The vehicle, which police believe was a silver or gold four-door sedan, was last seen fleeing the scene near Clover Lane.

King was said to have suffered from multiple gunshot wounds to the torso and arms.

According to incident reports, the police were called to the 300 block of 28th Avenue around 12:46 a.m. Thursday. They found King lying in a driveway, according to an incident report.

Witnesses told authorities the suspects appeared to be between 19 and 24 years old.

Police believe one suspect has a slender build, low haircut and a medium-to-dark complexion. A description of the second individual wasn't available.

The Columbus Police Department is asking for anyone with any knowledge about the homicide to contact Sgt. Ken Hudson at 706-225-4257 or the Robbery/Assault Unit at 706-653-3400.

King's death comes three weeks after 56-year-old William Edwards was found dead in his tent.

Edwards, who was homeless, lived in an area called tent city near the Second Avenue bridge.
