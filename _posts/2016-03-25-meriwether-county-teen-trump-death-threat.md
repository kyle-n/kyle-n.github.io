The Meriwether County Sheriff’s Office said it and agents of the U.S. Secret Service took a 15-year-old juvenile male into custody for terroristic threats.

The teen made death threats against presidential candidate Donald Trump, according to the release. Police said the teen is being detained at the Columbus Regional Youth Detention Center pending a hearing in juvenile court. The release noted that the Department of Juvenile Justice decided to detain the youth because of this incident and “previous law enforcement-related information.”

Meriwether County Sheriff Chuck Smith noted said there was another similar incident that happened recently in Troup County.

“I strongly suggest that parents monitor their kids’ activities on social media,” Smith said. “Hopefully parents can at least sit down and talk with their kids about the consequences of their actions. Use this as a prime example of what they should not be doing. It takes all of us working together to make our community stronger.”
