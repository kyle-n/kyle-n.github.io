A man was charged with taking a 17-year-old girl from her parents in Indiana according to testimony in Recorder's Court Friday morning.

Andreakus Crawford, 23, was arrested and charged with giving false information to a police officer and interstate interference with custody.

Sgt. Andrew Chesser of the Columbus Police Department testified in court that Crawford began an online relationship with the victim against her parents' wishes. Chesser said the victim's mother took out a temporary protective order against Crawford.

Chesser said he did not know through what website or how long the two had been in contact online. He estimated they'd known each other for several months.

During his testimony, Chesser said he learned of the case when a detective from Indiana contacted him. The Indiana detective told him he had been tracking the 17-year-old's phone as Crawford took her from Madison, Ind., to Columbus. The victim told her mother she had been coerced down there, the sergeant said.

The girl is considered a dependent and deprived minor (despite legally being an adult in Georgia) because she cannot go to school or hold a job, according to police.

Chesser said he did not know the nature of their relationship, though he said it could be sexual.

Crawford was charged with giving false information to a police officer, according to Chesser, when he told police he didn't know who the victim was after they asked for her location. Chesser said Crawford's aunt had already confirmed that he and the victim had gone out together. Crawford later told police the girl's location, according to testimony.

Judge Michael Cielinski listed Crawford's history of stalking, multiple domestic batteries and assault before giving him to a 30-day combined sentence for the false information charge and a $10,000 bond on interference, which he bound over to Superior Court.
