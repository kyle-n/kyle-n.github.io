ESPN's SEC writers put together a [list](http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/115004/counting-down-the-most-iconic-sec-plays-of-the-past-decade-nos-1-5) of the 25 biggest, most iconic plays in Southeastern Conference football in the last decade. Number one was Chris Davis' game-winning 109-yard kick return to beat Alabama in the 2013 Iron Bowl.

> Would you expect any other play than this one to be No. 1? This play had it all: the Iron Bowl rivalry, national championship implications and the drama of an as-time-expired finish. By now you know how it went: Alabama kicker Adam Griffith left a 57-yard field goal attempt short, Auburn's Chris Davis caught it nine yards deep in the end zone and began running. And running. And running some more, 109 yards to the opposite end zone to give the Tigers a 34-28 win over the Crimson Tide. It's a play that will live on forever in Iron Bowl -- and college football -- lore.

Auburn also took the number-three spot with "The Prayer at Jordan-Hare," their other crazy win from 2013 that happened just two weeks before the Iron Bowl. On fourth-and-18 with just 36 seconds left, Nick Marshall launched a Hail Mary to Ricardo Louis, who was surrounded by Georgia defenders. The ball bounced off a Bulldog helmet and into Louis' hands for the win.

As pointed out by [Yellowhammer](http://yellowhammernews.com/sports/kick-six-decades-most-iconic-play/), 13 of ESPN's top 25 plays involve Auburn or Alabama. The Crimson Tide claimed the number four, six and seven spots in the top 10 alone.

The [whole list](http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/115004/counting-down-the-most-iconic-sec-plays-of-the-past-decade-nos-1-5) is worth a read. The ESPN writers have a long memory and do a great job of pulling up highlight moments from 2007 or bowl games you may not have watched.
