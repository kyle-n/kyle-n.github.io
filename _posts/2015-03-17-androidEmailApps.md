Getting email on Android phones has always been a problem for me. Maybe it was the phones I was buying or the apps I was using, but getting mail reliably was always too difficult. Finding a good solution took a while. 

<!--break-->
Here are some of the best Android apps that pull messages down reliably. Hopefully this will save you some of the same trouble I ran into with getting messages - there's no reason Android users should be shortchanged a reliable email client. 

## K-9 Mail

K-9 is my favorite mail app for Android, far more than the stock AOSP effort. K-9 checks all the boxes: completely free, community-maintained and open-source. 

K-9 is a lot like AOSP Mail, but with a boatload more services. Little touches make K-9 into a much more powerful and functional app. While the app works out of the box, you can still change tons of server settings. 

The app can be a little weird at times, though it's far more reliable than most. I've seen some weirdness with unsent messages, especially on data. 

K-9's design is also a bit dated compared to its competitors. It's still using Holo instead of Material Design, and a redesign wouldn't be amiss here. 

Other than that, K-9 is a powerful email client you can get for free. That's pretty great.

### AquaMail

K-9 was my favorite app, at least until trying AquaMail. This one is a Material Design-themed email client that has a nice interface with some good ideas. 

AquaMail breaks its interface into two panes on my tablet, which isn't bad except for the too-wide left bar. 

Once you get into messages, though, it's pretty good to use. You can tap or swipe through different messages. For batch handling, drag your finger down the left side of the inbox list. It's a novel and convenient way of handling mail. 

AquaMail supports Gmail, IMAP, Google Apps, and Exchange. IMAP includes push support, for instant notifications of mail. 

Interestingly, AquaMail uses existing folders for its functions. As someone who has three sent folders from Exchange, OS X Mail and K-9 making separate ones, this is a nice touch. 

AquaMail is also an app after my own heart, because it supports LightFlow, Apex Launcher Pro, Nova Launcher, DashClock and Tasker. You can never have enough Tasker.

The biggest downside is its irritating signature. The free version of AquaMail attaches a signature telling the recipient you sent it with AquaMail, along with a link to the app's website. 

The only way to get rid of it and the two-account limit is to pay for a $5 unlocker key. I understand an app this nice doesn't happen without a lot of work, but it's not too much to ask that the free version be at least functional. 

Anything that adds a gimmicky advertisement onto my emails (especially for work) is unusable because it's just not professional. 

Basically, buy AquaMail or don't download it at all.

### CloudMagic Email

CloudMagic Email, though not Material Design-ified yet, has one of the nicer interfaces. It's a little bit of Holo, but done in a super tasteful way. I like it. 

From a functionality perspective, CloudMagic has earned widespread critical acclaim for its functionality. It supports Gmail, Exchange, IMAP and Office 365. 

CloudMagic stakes out new ground by working with other cloud-based services. You can save emails to Evernote, Wunderlist, OneNote, Trello, Salesforce.com, Instapaper and OmniFocus. 

CloudMagic seems more targeted at users who need a business-quality email application. If you find yourself scanning email app descriptions to see if your company's version of Exchange is supported, CloudMagic is your best bet. 

The free version works fine, though Pro is a bit expensive. Unlimited accounts, preference sync, remote wipe and priority support will run you $5 per month or $45 per year. 

Enterprise customers and productivity diehards will like CloudMagic, but everybody else should probably look elsewhere.

### Mailbox

Mailbox is the app that impressed Dropbox enough to be acquired by the famous cloud storage company. It's fast, stable and useful for managing email. 

Mailbox is one of the few apps that makes message management its first priority. It's built around swiping messages to snooze, archive, add to lists and delete. 

The app basically turns your inbox into a todo list, and it's pretty ingenious. I tried it a little and appreciated its slick interface. 

Unfortunately, that interface seems designed mostly for phones. Single-pane landscape tablet view? Tsk tsk. 

Mailbox also only supports only Gmail and iCloud accounts, which makes it a non-starter for people using anything else. The app description says support for more services is coming soon, whenever that is. 

Mailbox is a cool app that needs more time in development. Until then, it's only good for Gmail users.

### Final Thoughts

All these Email clients have different uses. K-9 is the best free one, though the interface is dated and unsexy. CloudMagic is best for business-oriented users. Mailbox has the most promise, though limited account support. 

AquaMail might be my new favorite, though the $5 pricetag is a bit much for an email app. I don't use my tablet for mail that often. 

I'd recommend K-9 as the email app that will work best for the majority of users. They'll appreciate the stability and features. Every other app on this list is still a great option, though.
