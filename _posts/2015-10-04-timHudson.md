[Proving them wrong](http://media.ledger-enquirer.com/static/projects/hudson/)

Why it's a highlight:

> Though I did not write this story, I worked on the formatting and publishing tools for it for several weeks to make a web-native version that would stand out and impress readers. 

> Our sports editor, Kevin Price, wrote it to celebrate a local man who had a long and successful pro career. I edited the story and produced the layout specifically for the web using [Sinclair](https://github.com/mcclatchy/sinclair), a McClatchy tool for building amazing web stories. 

> I started by hosting the story [on our website](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/sports/mlb/article37724499.html) with a couple other story assets. Sinclair scrapes the story and assets from our site (which we know will always be up) and reformats them in the visually appealing way. 

> Sinclair is not actively developed by McClatchy anymore, as far as I can tell, and required a lot of work to bring up to production levels. 

> My workflow was to run the story content and assets through the [Sinclair generator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuRuRdHZo6DPdG9oLXlVNjV2bDN0clJuX294dER0RUE&usp=sharing), download the .html file and edit in all the other necessary features. I removed the paragraph numbers and added a title, subhead, byline and meta tags so it would share properly on Facebook. The header formatting is based on CSS I added as an extra file to Sinclair, thanks to stuff from the Macon Telegraph. 

> It was a lot of work, but the feature looks fantastic and uses its web format to its advantage.
