Kayleigh Ferguson-Walker survived an unimaginable medical emergency. 

<!--break-->

In March, Kayleigh was a working mom in Coral Springs, Fla., six months pregnant. She contracted what seemed like a bad case of the flu. However, when it started getting worse, her husband, Ramon, rushed her to the emergency room at Broward Health Coral Springs. 

Doctors found she had an overwhelming infection which had claimed the life of her baby. The infection had also caused her to develop sepsis, when the body withdraws too much blood from a person’s extremities. 

Kayleigh was put into a coma and stayed in the hospital for two weeks as her limbs slowly died. In the end, she had to undergo a rare quadruple amputation.
