Anthony St. Pierre wants to make sure two Columbus girls have a fun Halloween, even after their family lost their trailer in a fire.

<!--break-->

St. Pierre plans to take them trick-or-treating from fire station #4 to every other fire station in Columbus.

St. Pierre, who's worked as a firefighter paramedic for 10 years, said he saw Raven and Robin after a fire destroyed their trailer near the corner of Old Cusseta Road and Allied Drive two weeks ago.

"I saw those kids and thought of my own," St. Pierre said.

St. Pierre said he did not know the last names of Raven, 2, and Robin, 5. Their family did not immediately respond to calls.

The fire medic said the Columbus Fire Department Brotherhood will buy the girls costumes to wear. Robin wants to dress up as Princess Aurora from "Sleeping Beauty," and Raven will probably go as Batgirl.

As a big comic book fan, St. Pierre plans to go as Batman. He said he had the costume from a previous trip to DragonCon in Atlanta and really likes the character.

To make the rest of Halloween work, St. Pierre said, the family will need donations of candy and any kind of supplies to rebuild a house.

"They lost everything," St. Pierre said. "Just take whatever you can to the closest fire station. Even if you can just give a candy bar, that's great."
