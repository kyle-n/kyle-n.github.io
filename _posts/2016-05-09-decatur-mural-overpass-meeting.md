The city of Decatur announced in a [blog post](http://thedecaturminute.com/2016/05/06/marta-mural-project-community-input-meeting/) Friday that it wants input from residents about what they want to see in a mural. The transportation organization  is working on a large piece of public art which will be displayed on the overpass at the corner of W. Trinity Place and Atlanta Avenue.

The meeting is Wednesday, May 11, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Ebster Recreation Center at 105 Electric Avenue. 

Joey Fillastre and Felici Asteinza of MILAGROS Collective, the artists, will be there to discuss their work and philosophy. "The artists have come up with some fun, creative ways to engage our collective imagination(s) as we reflect and envision what will ultimately become our community mural based on the Making History in Our Region theme," the announcement reads. 

To RSVP or ask questions, call 404 - 371 - 9583. Those who cannot make this meeting can also attend an additional community input meeting in August. 

The city said it expects the mural to be complete by October. There is [an initiative](http://commuting.blog.ajc.com/2016/03/21/marta-stations-to-feature-mural-artwork/) to create murals representative of their communities around Atlanta.
