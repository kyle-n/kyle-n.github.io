### About Compose

Compose for Substack is a simple, clean, beautiful native editor for writing Substack email newsletters in Markdown. No more juggling tabs in a web browser - Compose offers an iPhone and iPad-first experience. 

Compose has full interoperability with the Substack web editor. Any changes you make in Substack's web editor will be reflected in Compose and vice versa. 

The app is free-to-try. You can publish or schedule up to three posts. After that, Compose requires a Pro Subscription for $5 a month, a common price for Patreons. Subscriptions fund ongoing work to keep Compose compatible with Substack and cool new features.

Compose is available right now for iOS and iPadOS 14. The Mac version will launch with macOS Big Sur.

### Editor features

### About the tech

Compose for Substack is almost all SwiftUI. It uses several of the awesome new SwiftUI APIs introduced for iOS 14, including the iPadOS three-column layout. 

The exception is the text editor, which wraps UIKit to provide live syntax highlighting.

### About the developer

Kyle Nazario is an indie developer best known for [HighlightedTextEditor](https://github.com/kyle-n/HighlightedTextEditor), an open-source SwiftUI view that dynamically highlights text as the user types.
