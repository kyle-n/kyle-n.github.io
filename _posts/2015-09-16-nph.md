Did you see Big Al at Alabama's opener against Wisconsin? That was Neil Patrick Harris, star of ["How I Met Your Mother"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C19US6rqqAo) and ["Doogie Howser"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrERtikdPus). He started a variety show called "[Best Time Ever](http://www.nbc.com/best-time-ever)" and followed a couple from Tuscaloosa for the first episode. One of his disguises? Big Al.

NPH wore the full costume onto the field and spent some time as the mascot (twerking) before going into the stands to dance weirdly in place next to the couple and get on the kiss cam. If you've ever wondered what it looks like when Big Al tries to give two people a kiss, well... it's really just a hug.

There's some more dancing and a lot of NPH sweating inside the costume. Being Big Al ain't easy.

Watch the segment below.
