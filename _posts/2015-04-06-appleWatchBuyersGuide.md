The Apple Watch is coming April 24 in a surprising number of different options. There are different styles for the band, materials, and even size. We've covered the different bands and materials available in our buyer's guide to the Apple Watch.

However, which size is best for you? The Apple Watch comes in two sizes: 38 and 42 millimeters. How are you supposed to know which size is best, and which feels right? We have a couple options to try it. 

## Option 1: Printout

Try this printable cutout, courtesy of WonderHowTo. Download it and print it at 100%. The result is a little silly, but it'll show you the Apple Watch at a different size and with a strap. 

Don't have a printer? You can also fold up a dollar bill in the shape of a 38-mm Apple Watch with these instructions from Time. 

While it can't give a sense of the weight and quality of the Apple Watch, the printout is a fun little project that can show you what it'll look like on your wrist. 

### Option 2: Apple Store

The best way to try the Apple Watch is to make an appointment to go to an Apple Store in person. That opens up April 10. You can walk in and try it on, though you'll have to wait in line with other people. 

You're better off making an appointment with the Apple Store. No wait, and you can spend some quality time with the watch. 

### Option 3: Download the app

The Apple Store app also has an option for displaying the Apple Watch on your device. It's free to download and can be used to make a reservation at the Apple Store as well. 

To try it on your iPhone, open the Apple Store app. Select any of the Apple Watches, "View pricing" in the upper right, then "Compare case sizes."

It'll show the Apple Watch at its actual size on your phone's display. This works on all iPhones- even my iPhone 5 was large enough to display the 42-mm version. 

### Pricing Differences

One thing to keep in mind when deciding between Apple Watch sizes is the price difference. The 42-mm version costs on average $50 more than the 38-mm equivalent. 

The larger size is targeted at men in general, though both sizes could work perfectly well on anyone as they're both small. 

### Final Thoughts

Of all the options, I liked the Apple Store app the best. It was the most convenient and showed the different sizes well enough right there on my phone (would definitely get the 42-mm size if I could). 

I would definitely recommend trying one on in person in the Apple Store, especially if you're serious about buying one. That's the best way to get a sense of the weight and quality of the watch, as well as the size. 

Until then, definitely check out one of the options we've listed. Until we get to the April 24 release date, there's not much else to do. Until launch!
