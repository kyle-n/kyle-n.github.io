If you hear a lot of sirens and see emergency response vehicles near Fort Benning today, this is the most likely cause.

Fort Benning personnel are conducting a "mass casualty exercise" today near Lawson Army Airfield, according to a release. The Army advises anyone entering post through the Fort Mitchell access point should prepare for delays between now and noon.

The exercise will also close Sunshine Road along the airfield for 15 minutes once it begins.

The release said the exercise would help keep first responders' skills sharp in the event of an actual emergency.
