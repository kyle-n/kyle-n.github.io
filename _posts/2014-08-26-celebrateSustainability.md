For at least one afternoon, it was easy being green.

Students gathered in the Davis Arboretum Thursday, Aug. 14 before classes to learn about sustainable growth and environmentalism at the Sustainability Picnic.

Students gathered in a clearing by the pond, sitting on the grass in clumps and listening to a three-piece cover band. They talked among themselves and giggled as Aubie danced along to the music and climbed a tree.

In the back, environmentally focused student groups set up their tables with information for the attendees.

Garrett Kizer, president of the Environmental Awareness Organization, said the event helps such groups to recruit.

"It's also a really cool environment to see people that might be interested in our organization without standing on the concourse and yelling at them and throwing things at them," Kizer said. "Here it's a little bit more relaxed. We have a band that's playing, we have food [and] people that just kinda go from table to table and talk to you."

The students wandered between the tables and free food: whole wheat couscous pilaf, baked sweet potato salad and roasted garlic hummus. They ate off of upside-down Frisbees with wooden sporks.

"The free food is definitely a good way to help people, especially when you're trying to get incoming freshmen," Kizer said. "I remember when I was a freshman, everything I did [during] Welcome Week was trying to find free food."

James Elrod, freshman in forestry, said he came mostly for the food. However, he said one organization's table caught his interest.

"I haven't really looked through too many of the tables, but I like the recycling one," Elrod said. "I hate throwing stuff away."

Elrod said if not for previous commitments, he would consider joining an organization related to his interest in the environment.

"Boy Scouts is real oriented to [recycling], plus my major. It all kind of ties together," Elrod said.

Nathan McWhirter, junior in mechanical engineering and sustainability studies and secretary of Auburn Real Food Challenge, said he hoped his group could find more members from the students gathered at the picnic.

"Our group is pretty small right now this year," McWhirter said. "We had two people that were supposed to be officers, [who] actually got other commitments this semester, so we're just down to three officers. So we're really looking to grow our group this semester and this school year."

McWhirter said he also hopes to help educate students on the merits of environmentalism and sustainable food.

"We're working to get more local, community-based, ecologically sound, fair and humane foods on campus," McWhirter said.

These efforts are working, producing changes, such as the Village bulk food bins and reusable silverware in campus dining halls.

AU Dining is also running a program with Chartwells, which runs Auburn's dining program, and SuperGrow, an organic food grower, to serve more organic, locally grown food to students. It aims to make 20 percent of its food local and organic by fall 2015.

McWhirter said Auburn could see more environmentally friendly changes if there is demand from the students.

"Auburn is responsive to its students," McWhirter said. "If people are interested in this, it's going to happen on campus."
