Carmike 15 will allow "Minecraft" fans to play the game in the theater with the help of [Super League Gaming](https://superleague.com/). The group created a mod called "theater mode" that allows up to 100 gamers to play simultaneously while watching the action unfold on screen.

The event host will be prominent Minecraft YouTuber [ParkerGames](https://www.youtube.com/user/MineplexOfficial). The event starts at 10:30 a.m., Nov. 14. It will last 100 minutes. [Tickets](https://superleague.com/carmike) cost $20. Parents are welcome to stay and watch for free. Participants should bring their own laptops.

"We know gamers really want to get out of their rooms and start playing video games in a much more social atmosphere surrounded by like-minded peers," said Super Leage Gaming president and COO Brett Morris. "Competing in solitude is outdated."
