Bloomberg Politics published a poll conducted by Purple Strategies that found Donald Trump led the other Republican candidates in Southern states due to vote by March 1.

<!--break-->

An online Bloomberg Politics poll shows the billionaire is backed by 37 percent of likely Republican presidential primary voters in the seven states surveyed, while Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas are tied at 20 percent. [...]

The findings demonstrate the broad-based nature of Trump's support and how primary voters -- even conservatives and evangelicals who might find issues with his personal history -- have accepted him, making it harder for his rivals to take him down.
Georgia and Alabama are considered to have some of the most conservative and religious voters in the country. Early in the campaign season pundits expected Trump, a twice-divorced New Yorker, to not be able to connect with religious voters.

According to the Bloomberg poll, Trump did not do as well on questions of being a committed Christian as he did on those of terrorism and having a vision for the future.

"These voters rate Trump as the least conservative and the least committed Christian of the three top candidates, and yet he still leads," said pollster Doug Usher, who led the survey. "He's turning everything we thought we knew about Republican primary voters on its head."
