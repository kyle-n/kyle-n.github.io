An Auburn man and his son have seriously impressive Star Wars outfits. Ronnie Sparks and his son Will Sparks spend more than $1,000 every time they build a stormtrooper costume. From a [profile](http://www.theplainsman.com/article/2016/02/stormtrooping-is-a-family-affair-for-local-father-and-son-duo) in the Auburn Plainsman:

> The two have spent time and money into crafting the perfect act. The stormtroopers attend events such as birthday parties, sporting events, church get-togethers and community events to share their love for "Star Wars."

> Ronnie said he first thought of the Auburn-Opelika stormtroopers after hearing about the 501st Legion, a national "Star Wars" costuming group out of Birmingham. The love for the movie and culture spawned from his early years of fandom.

> "I remember standing in line at a little bitty theater in Georgia," Ronnie said. "I was almost 7 years old. The signs, the movie, the characters ... I remember thinking how great it all was."

The two visited the Auburn Public Library in costume, much to the delight of the library's staff and visitors. Will Sparks said children have asked him if he's a real person under the armor.
