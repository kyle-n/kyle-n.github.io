### Camera

**4K 4 U** uses the camera to scan barcodes on 4K DVDs. It DOES:

* Use the barcode to look up the movie title

It DOES NOT:

* Take or save photos
* Access any of your previously saved photos

**4K 4 U** WILL NEVER:

* Collect your personal information in any way. I don't want it!

### Searches

All searches for movies are performed on-device. Movies are downloaded straight from the [spreadsheet](1). No user data whatsoever is tracked. The app does not report back in any way to me.
