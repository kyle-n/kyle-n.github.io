For the Robinson family, Halloween was Christmas.

<!--break-->

Anthony St. Pierre, a Columbus firefighter paramedic, [collected donations]({% post_url 2015-09-29-batman %}) of toys, blankets and clothing for the family for the past month. On Halloween, he presented the family with the collection.

The Robinsons have had a hard month. On Sept. 15, Tuesday, John Robinson's mother passed away. Her funeral was on Friday. On Saturday, the Robinson's rental trailer caught fire. Sunday was Robin's fifth birthday.

"We lost it all," John said. "Every bit."

John said what wasn't ruined by the fire was stolen when the family was living out of a motel. He said the "scavengers" took kitchen appliances, DVD players (only one worked) and a TV bought for $3 at a garage sale.

St. Pierre said when he saw Raven Rose Robinson, 2, and Robin Renee Robinson, 5, he thought of his own children and wanted to give them a good Halloween. He originally planned to have the kids go to fire stations all over Columbus for a private trick-or-treat, but the Robinson parents John and Jessica decided it would be better to stay at fire station #4 on North Oakley Drive.

For their private Halloween, Robin and Raven dressed up as princesses. St. Pierre, a comic book fan, came as Batman. His friend Caitlin Norton drove in from Atlanta and dressed as Batgirl to help present the donations to the family.

"The oldest one, Robin, she almost started crying when she saw all of this," Norton said. "Even Raven was starting to cry because all of the stuff was for them. That's what it's all about right there."

Robin and Raven got to play with dozens of toys donated by people as far away as Los Angeles and Ohio.

St. Pierre said news of the family's plight spread over social media and inspired an outpouring of donations. He said he filled up one of the ambulances several times over with all the blankets and toys people donated.

"(This) gives our girls things they haven't had for a month," John said. "We appreciate it. It's nice to see people willing to help."

If you'd like to donate gently used goods or toys, drop them off at the fire station at 200 North Oakley Drive, Columbus, GA 31907.
