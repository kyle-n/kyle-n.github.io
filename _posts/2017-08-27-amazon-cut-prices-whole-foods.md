In addition to across-the-board discounts, Amazon Prime members [will see special deals](http://www.ajc.com/news/national/amazon-prime-members-receive-discounts-whole-foods/WQhL94TgHNVVtRtMJApa9L/). 

For longtime shoppers at Whole Foods, the store given the unflattering nickname “Whole Paycheck,” this might seem odd. However, Amazon wants the chain to be more competitive with other groceries. 

“The (profit) margins at Whole Foods probably were too high,” said Jeff Roster, vice president of retail strategy at the IHL Group, a Tennessee-based research firm. “’Whole Paycheck’ wasn’t just a meme. It was pretty darn accurate. There’s room to breathe.”
