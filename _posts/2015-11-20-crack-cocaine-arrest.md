A report from the incident said Officer Jason Mausar conducted a traffic stop on a 1996 Toyota Corolla with a Georgia tag PNE-8045 for failure to indicate a left turn onto Talbotton Road from 27th Street.

Police said Winifred Hall, 56, and John Beasley, 64, were in the vehicle.

Mausar said in his report that he saw Hall, the front seat passenger, stuff an unknown object into her purse. He said Columbus police Officer Aguilar observed Hall try to conceal the unknown object.

Police also said Hill handed Aguilar a napkin with 0.1 grams of crack cocaine with a street value of $10.

Police searched the vehicle and found a small black bag with 1 gram of marijuana with a street value of $10, according to the report. Police said Beasley admitted the marijuana belonged to him.

Beasley was charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana and issued a traffic citation, while Hill was charged with violation of the Georgia Controlled Substance Act by possessing a Schedule II drug, according to the report. Police said the two were transported to the Muscogee County Jail.
