In 2003, Steve Humble, a mechanical engineer, wanted to add secret rooms like he’d seen in the movies to the house he was renting. According to his website, he found that there was no company at the time specializing in secret passageways. He began building motorized secret passages out of his parents’ garage in Arizona and quit his job.

Now he runs his own company, Creative Home Engineering, which bills itself as “the world’s premier designer and manufacturer of motorized and high-security secret passageways.”
