As of Sunday, the Powerball jackpot is up to $375 million. No one has claimed their prize yet. 

<!--break-->

Drawings are held on Wednesday and Saturday nights on Channel 2 at 11 p.m. eastern. The next drawing for the $375 million price is June 7. Powerplay is 4x.

The winning numbers from Saturday’s drawing were 03, 09, 21, 41, 54 and the PowerBall is 25.

The current prize is believed to be one of the largest in the history of the Powerball. The jackpot has driven lottery ticket sales around the state. 

One woman [told the AJC](http://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/metro-atlantans-scoop-tickets-for-337m-powerball-drawing/ZVAgH1oo4LAYwQoLE1HL5J/) if she won, she would “buy a lifelong vacation.” 

Those interested in playing Powerball can buy a ticket for $2, or $3 for access to an extra $1-2 million prize. Check out our [guide to the Powerball](http://www.ajc.com/news/local/where-you-can-play-powerball-atlanta/TBlZN3MrUkGfLxJ9CKJAGJ/) to learn how to play.
