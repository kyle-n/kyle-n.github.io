The way Calvin Wagner tells it, cars of the future won't run primarily on gas. They'll mostly be hybrids or entirely electric.

Wagner, senior in electrical engineering, is captain of Auburn's Formula Society of Automotive Engineers Electric Car Team. The Formula SAE Electric Team is a group of 20 students, mostly engineers, who are building Auburn's first student-made electric drag racing car.

The program is one of two in the SEC, according to Peter Jones, Woltosz War Eagle Motor Sports professor.

The club began with preliminary meetings in December 2013. David Sweet, team member and senior in mechanical engineering, said the first official meeting was not until January.

The 2014-15 school year will be the club's first time working on a car.

Wagner said he was drawn to the Formula Electric team because of training sessions he received while working as a Ford mechanic warning about the danger of working with electric vehicles.

"They gave us all these danger sessions, like, 'This will kill you, do not touch the orange wires while it's live,'" Wagner said. "I thought, 'That's sounds cool. I like that.'"

Working with electric cars poses unique challenges compared to conventional motor vehicles, the most dangerous being the current that powers the engine.

"You will die if you mess up with these batteries," Wagner said.

However, electric-powered engines offer advantages over their gas-powered counterparts. Where a combustion engine might take a small amount of time to accelerate to a set speed, electric engines can reach that level even quicker, Wagner said, citing torque curves.

This quality is vital in a drag racer. Wagner said the team doesn't worry as much about their car's top speed as much as its ability to accelerate as quickly as possible.

Wagner also said the team plans to build its car by spring to race it in the 2015 Formula SAE Electric race in Lincoln, Nebraska.

For their first car, Auburn's Formula Electric team is focusing on gathering sponsors and designing a car that works.

"Our whole premise for the first year is simplicity," Wagner said. "No bullcrap, no fancy stuff, just a simple car that passes technical inspection [at the Lincoln race]."

Stuart Coats, chief chassis engineer and sophomore in mechanical engineering, said the project has gone well so far, with only a few issues.

"A lot of challenges are issues with lack of knowledge," Coats said. "We're a newer team, so we don't have that much knowledge. The way we've gotten past those is by asking our neighbors in the shop, our sister team, [Formula SAE] combustion. They've been very, very helpful to us."

Coats said the Formula Electric team's biggest issues stem from its new status. The team had to order its own tools and engine parts from all over the world in order to start building the car.

Racecar-quality tools and engine parts don't come cheap, either. Sweet said the Formula Electric team is looking for sponsors to fund its project.

"The car in total each year is estimated around $60,000," Sweet said. "We're trying to keep it simple this year, but because we have to build up our own infrastructure -- tools, toolbox, all the other power supplies that are a big deal -- it's going to cost us around $60-80,000 for this first year, maybe even more."

Despite the challenges, Sweet said he enjoys his work on the Formula Electric team. "I've always had an interest in vehicles," Sweet said. "The electric vehicle market has grown a lot in the previous years, and I think it will only continue to do so. (Working on the car) is exciting and it's practical."
