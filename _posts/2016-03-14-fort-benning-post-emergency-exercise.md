Fort Benning might look a little more active Tuesday morning.

<!--break-->

The Army released a notice saying it would conduct a post-wide emergency preparedness training exercise between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. March 15.

People on or near the installation may notice an increased number of emergency response vehicles, sirens and buildings cordoned off by law enforcement during the day.

People near the base may also encounter traffic detours and delays. Army staff encourages motorists to allow themselves extra time if traveling near post.
