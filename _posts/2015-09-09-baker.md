A man pleaded not guilty to charges of child molestation today in Recorder's Court.

Columbus police said a child reported Stefon T. Baker touched her crotch over her clothes and showed her pornography on a phone.

The incident was originally reported on June 26, according to police. Police said they questioned Baker, who denied the charges at the time.

Baker came in Tuesday at 12:35 p.m. to take a polygraph test and speak with police, during which he admitted to child molestation, according to testimony from police.

Judge Michael Cielinski set Baker's bond at $20,000 and bound the case over to Superior Court.
