We don’t know exactly what caused the fire which [brought down a bridge](http://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/breaking-deal-declares-state-emergency-after-bridge-collapse/FRzANVZ9vgyWW2WZfyN6jI/) on I-85 near Ga. 400 and brought traffic to a screeching halt. It [wasn’t terrorism](http://www.ajc.com/news/local/georgia-state-patrol-says-terrorism-not-suspected-bridge-fire-collapse/hpejdPO8j1npgNNI1B2i6H/), but it [could have been PVC](http://www.ajc.com/news/local/gov-deal-pvc-pipes-may-behind-bridge-fire/xffMH7wSUPA3dgvXIhizYP/).

However, a viewer of WSB-TV [tweeted](https://twitter.com/wsbtv/status/847589791390728192/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fwsbtv%2Fstatus%2F847589791390728192) this photo at the news station of the fire in its infancy. It shows the smallest amount of flames and smoke of any picture of the disaster we’ve seen so far, making it the earliest record we can find of the fire.

Thankfully, as of 11 p.m. Thursday there were not reports of anyone being hurt in the fire or the subsequent bridge collapse. We’re rounded up [everything you need to know about the I-85 collapse](http://www.ajc.com/news/local/things-know-about-the-fiery-bridge-collapse/Rtw9PdbyFBoWchJPESywzJ/).
