The mayors of Gulf Shores and Orange Beach are fed up with the trash and chaos from spring breakers. From [AL.com](http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2016/03/beach_mayors_issue_ultimatium.html#incart_river_home_pop):

> Police in Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have broken up crowds of over 1,000, arrested dozens for underage drinking and stepped up DUI patrols. And if Spring Break 2016 doesn't calm itself very soon, mayors are ready to call for alcohol bans on the beach ahead of 2017.

According to the Facebook page [Spring Break Awareness Gulf Shores](https://www.facebook.com/Spring-Break-Nightmares-Gulf-Shores-1746106618956568/?fref=ts), students from around the South and Texas have been leaving trash and contributing to an atmosphere locals call unfriendly to families.

Orange Beach Mayor Tony Kennon said while he was willing to ban alcohol on the beach, he emphasized the differences between his town and Panama City, which made headlines for its [attempts](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/nation-world/national/article64669922.html) to limit spring breakers.

Judging from the Gulf Shores Facebook page, several college students have recognized the backlash against all the trash from spring break and are working to fix the problem.

Fixing the problem is students' best bet against the beaches ending up like Panama City Beach, which passed rules banning alcohol on the beach, mandating that bars close at 2 a.m. and prohibiting loitering in parking lots.
