Stone Mountain has seen five ribbon cuttings for “new or expanded businesses” since the start of March, according to a press release from the City of Stone Mountain Downtown Development Authority.

A sixth business, Flex Point Studio, will have its ribbon cutting during a ceremony on Wednesday, March 11, at 11 a.m. at 913 Main Street, Suite B. It will also have an opening party this Saturday with a DJ, food, free raffle and demo class.

According to the release, the expansions and openings have created approximately eight new jobs. This rate of openings compares with its 2015 equivalent time period.

The newest business, Flex Point Studio, will offer fitness classes featuring yoga, Zumba, tap, hip-hop dance, contemporary dance, African dance, modern dance and ballet. According to the release, the studio also plans to include a “Mommy and Me” class on Sundays.

Flex Point owner Jennifer Cornelius said she was tired of driving into Atlanta for the fitness classes she enjoyed.

“So I put together my dance background, my legal expertise and public relations skills and have created Flex Point Sudio,” Cornelius says. “I hope it will fill the gap in fitness that people are looking for.”

The other new businesses and expansions include Better Body Image, Cool Breeze Smoothie, Stone Mountain Manor, Twisted Swisher and Vim Rise (website under construction, call 770-217-9882). 

Jean Milice, co-owner of Vim Rise, said he and his wife Frida Milice started their tax and insurance business in Stone Mountain because it was "suitable" and his wife had lots of clients in the area. He said the city was "very helpful in every step of the way" while they were getting started, and he'd recomend the area to another small business. 

"I wouldn't want them to open another tax prep business on the same street, but there's plenty of vacancies in the area," Milice said. 

Mechel McKinley, executive director of the city's Downtown Development Authority, said Stone Mountain is still bringing in more businesses.

“We’re not done yet,” McKinley says. “Another business will be finished with an expansion soon and there are three more ribbon cuttings in the planning stages.”
