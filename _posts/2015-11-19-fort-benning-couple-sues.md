A Fort Benning couple has filed a lawsuit against the Tri County Animal Shelter to get their dog back from the Tri County Animal Rescue.

<!--break-->

"This family does not now nor have they ever wanted to be a party in a lawsuit," said attorney Penny Furr in a statement to the Ledger-Enquirer. "However, this appears to be the only way they have a chance of getting Spot, their beloved dog, back. If there were other options they would be taking them."

Penny and Ed Furr filed a lawsuit against against the Tri County Rescue in the Superior Court of Taylor County. The suit names Thomas and Andrea Hoffman, a mother and son who run the rescue.

The couple, Blake and Ashley Lechner, said previously they surrendered the dog because Blake was going to be transferred to Korea sometime in 2016. The Hoffmans, however, said when the couple dropped off the dog, they did it because of behavioral issues. Thomas [told the Ledger-Enquirer](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/military/article44579262.html) that the Lechners only wanted the dog back after others saw the rescue post its picture for an adoption ad and became embarrassed that they had surrendered their dog to Fort Benning Animal Control.

"Mr. Lechner has been been called a liar regarding the reasons they relinquished Spot," Penny Furr said in the statement. "He has never lied about that. There were a number of reasons they decided to give up Spot."

Furr lists moving to Korea and being "overwhelmed" among a number of reasons contributing to the Lechners' decision to surrender Spot.

The full text of the lawsuit alleges six counts of misconduct against the rescue, including that the Hoffmans tried to arrange foster care in a foreign state to remove Spot from Georgia jurisdiction. The Furrs asked for a temporary and permanent injunction to return Spot in order to prevent him from being moved out of state.

The two parties have tried to influence public opinion over the past week. Nadine Butler, who works for the Tri County Rescue, started a [Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/all-animal-advocates-spot-deserves-better?recruiter=24787128&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=share_page&utm_term=des-lg-share_petition-custom_msg) to give Spot a better life.

"Spot was evaluated by a number of outside sources," Butler said. "Behavior problems were cited by multiple sources, including the owners themselves... The dog is not socialized, and suffers from severe fear and anxiety, especially of men, and men in uniform."

The full petition lists a number of other problems with the dog.

Ed Furr said the case will have a hearing on Dec. 8.

"We simply hope the legal reasons we've laid out will prevail," he said.

The full text of Penny Furr's statement is below:{% include footnote num='1' note="I reached out to Thomas Hoffman, but he did not answer a call. That was fine, he said he's often out of cell phone reach. I texted him as well and received only cryptic answers. 'If I get served it's going to court,' he replied tersely to several questions." %}

> This family does not now nor have they ever wanted to be a party in a lawsuit. However, this appears to be the only way they have a chance of getting Spot, their beloved dog, back. If there were other options they would be taking them.

> It appears that the people who have Spot want to win even when it is at his expense. Spot has never been an aggressive dog. He has always been an exuberant, happy puppy. If the allegations that are being made by the Rescue are true the family is terrified with what is happening to Spot while he is out of their custody.

> The family admits that their decision to relinquish Spot was the worst mistake they have ever made. It has devastated the family especially their young son who had an incredible bond with Spot. The family did not realize how strong that bond was until Spot was gone. This is why they immediately started trying to get Spot back.

> The family believed they were turning the dog in to Fort Benning Animal Control and Animal Shelter. They had no idea they were really dealing with a rescue organization. The page that was placed on Facebook clearly stated the organization was Fort Benning Animal Control and Animal Shelter. Immediately after this happened that page was removed.

> Mr.  Lechner has been called a liar regarding the reasons they relinquished Spot. He has never lied about that. There were a number of reasons they decided to give up Spot. They believed they would be relocating. Spot was very active and jumped up when he was excited. They were overwhelmed with all of the things that were happening in their lives.  There was not one reason but many that led to this error.

> It is not the first time a family that is overwhelmed and stressed would have made a mistake. I am amazed at the lack of empathy and compassion for this family. So many people have attacked this family who know nothing about them. They are in pain. This hurts them more than most of you could know. Human beings make mistakes. The father's first post on the internet asked for forgiveness from God, his family, and Spot. He also said how much he loved his family and that includes Spot.

> I feel certain that Spot would be the first to forgive. That is how dogs are. There is no doubt that Spot loves his family and wants them back. Why is it so hard for human beings to forgive?

> This is not what rescue is about. Rescue is there for dogs who have no one to love and care for them. At least one dog is now suffering because Spot is not being allowed to return home. He is taking space where a dog with no one could be.

> Having worked with rescue for many years I know that our first goal is to keep the family together. When the family is a military family there are many options available. Many shelters and rescues have arranged long term fosters and have kept dogs for the family for extended periods of time. There are even grants available to assist families in paying costs to relocate dogs to other countries. It is sad that none of the options were made available to the Lechners.

> If there is going to be a Fort Benning Animal Control and Shelter I would hope they would offer every military family all of the options before breaking up the family. Had these options been made available Spot never would have been removed from his family.

> The matter is now in the Court and the Lechners hope that can reunite their family. We are always open to resolution if the rescue is willing. If they are concerned about Spot the family will gladly hire a trainer to come to their home and work with Spot. We are entering the holiday period. Why not reunite this family and give his place at the rescue to a stray dog who has no one?
