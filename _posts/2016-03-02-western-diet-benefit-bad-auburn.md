Michael Greene, an assistant professor of nutrition at Auburn University, is worried about the effects and growing popularity of the Western (North America, Europe, etc) diet. He and other researchers presented their work at Boshell Research Day on Feb. 26. From an interview with the university press:

> "I'm concerned about the next generation in our contry and for other countries that aspire to become more Westernized," said Greene. "There are health consequences that come with Westernization.

> "We [are] very focused on the maladies. It's hard to find any positives associated with consuming this diet."

Greene said his research found that a Western diet with high amounts of fat and sugar water (like you'd find in soda) could cause advanced liver disease in mouse models of obesity. He told the university press that eating high amounts of red meat, refined sugars, saturated fat and few fibers plays a role in diseases of the gut, brain, body fat or liver.

The research fair also included studies about the effects of genetics and meal timing on weight gain.

Healthy food has been a concern for Columbus recently, with our city hosting the 19th annual Georgia Organics Conference to [focus on locally grown and organic food](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/latest-news/article62040937.html).
