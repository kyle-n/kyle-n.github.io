Steven Moore has a bad heart.

<!--break-->

"I do well enough," Moore said. "I get tired easily and can't work."

The Phenix City native is attempting to raise money through a [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/Steven-Moore). After years of working as a volunteer firefighter in Seale and youth group leader for St. Mark Free Will Baptist Church, he's hoping people will give back for a surgery.

Moore said he was born and bred in Phenix City, graduating from Central High School. In 1973, he left to join the Army where he worked as a Morse code translator. In 1977, Moore started a 25-year career in aviation. The job took him all over the country as he worked his way up from cleaner to regional manager of the Northeast.

After he couldn't do the work any more, Moore kept himself busy as a volunteer firefighter in Seale. He worked as a first responder and firefighter, burning buildings and all.

For the last three to four years, though, he said he stuck to "engineer" duties to stay out of the front line.

When he felt the defibulator shock his pacemaker twice during a traffic accident, though, Moore said he knew it was time to retire.

Moore's heart has been bad for a while. After five heart attacks and six stents and two pacemakers, it can't pump blood like most people's hearts can. According to [Sutter Health Network](http://www.cpmc.org/services/heart/tx/ejectionfraction.html), a normal heart can pump out 55 to 75 percent of the blood within it with every heartbeat.

Moore said his heart can pump 15 percent, well below the norm. It means he can't drink more than two liters of liquids a day or his lungs fill up with fluid. A bad heart means he could drown on dry land.

"The heart's worn out," Moore said. "The muscle, it's not there."

This April was the tipping point. Moore suffered a fifth heart attack while in the hospital for a GI bleed from an ulcer. It was time for a change.

Moore is on the heart transplant list. In six months to a year, he'll have to move to Birmingham to stay close to the hospital at UAB for the surgery and recovery. Medicare covers 70 percent of the $300,000 surgery, but not all of it. It also doesn't cover the drugs that will keep his body from rejecting the heart, or the costs of moving close to Birmingham to stay close to the hospital.

Moore doesn't have a lot of other financial options. He can't work. His wife, Kathy, has had two strokes, an elbow injury from a car crash and is legally blind.

"It's been a journey for us," he said.

Moore said he needs the transplant so he can go back to work. He doesn't know when it'll be his turn for a transplant. If it doesn't work out, it means trying to get a [left ventricular assist device](http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/left-ventricular-assist-device) (LVAD, [the thing Dick Cheney used](http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2014spring/article3.html)) or accepting the worst.

Moore said he hopes people will help with some of his costs for the transplant.

"With the faith I have, God puts no more on you than you can handle," Moore said. "Seems like a pretty hard test of faith sometimes. God has a plan for all of us. He has something else for me out there."
