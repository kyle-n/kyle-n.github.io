A bit of viral fluff content has been making the rounds on Facebook claiming that Scarlett Johansson, star of "The Avengers" and "Her," is moving to Columbus. From the "article:"

<!--break-->

> In a surprise to everyone in Los Angeles and certainly everyone in Columbus, Georgia, Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson announced today in an interview that she was moving to Columbus.  Scarlett said that she was “tired of the L.A. lifestyle” and wanted to “live in a place where people are just people and whose sincerity you don’t have to always question”.<br><br>Johansson recently visited the area for a few days and, according to her publicist, “Scarlett immediately fell in love with the relaxed southern lifestyle, the friendly people, and the beautiful scenery of the Columbus area and was telling everyone that she was going to move there.”

This story is completely false. [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/celebrity-moving-small-towns/), a mythbusting website, noted that a ring of "fantasy news" websites has been churning out these stories for small towns across the country. Here's one made-up brief about Tom Cruise moving to Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania:

> In a surprise to everyone in Hollywood and certainly everyone in Beaver Falls, Tom Cruise announced today in an interview that he was “tired of the Hollywood lifestyle” and that he wanted to “live in a place where people were people and whose sincerity you didn’t have to question”. He recently visited Beaver Falls while scouting out a film location with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and, according to Bruckheimer, “Tom immediately fell in love with the relaxed lifestyle and the tranquil beauty of the surrounding countryside and was telling everyone that he was going to move there.”

There are also stories about Brad Pitt [moving to Breaux Bridge, La.](http://www.mckenziepost.com/new-orleans/brad-pitt-and-angelina-moving-to-breaux-bridge-louisiana/), Leonardo DiCaprio [moving to Woodstock, Ill.](http://www.snopes.com/leonardo-dicaprio-woodstock-illinois/), and Justin Bieber [moving to Sandy, Ore.](http://www.thatsfake.com/is-pop-star-justin-bieber-moving-to-sandy-in-oregon/), that have remarkably similar formats. Whoever is running these sites uses the same template and fills in the quotes with facts about the town they find on Google, apparently.

The websites seem designed to trick readers into sharing the story so the sites collect pageviews. They have generic names like "Local News 33" or "The McKenzie Post" to make the celebrity stories seem more legitimate.

The only overt admittances of making things up are on the "About Us" pages of these content factories. The one running the fake Scarlett Johansson story says "All news articles on localnews33.com are satire or pure fantasy," but of course the site doesn't put that on the article itself.

So next time you see an incredible story about a celebrity moving to a small town, just remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
