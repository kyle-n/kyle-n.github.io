Alabama fans with long memories may remember Bart Starr, the hall of Fame quarterback who played for the Tide and the Green Bay Packers. His wife Cherry Starr recently spoke with AL.com to explain the real reason behind Bart's back injuries:

> "[H]is back was never right after [the hazing]," Cherry Starr said. "It was horrible. It was not a football injury. It was an injury sustained from hazing. His whole back all the way up to his rib cage looked like a piece of raw meat. The bruising went all the way up his back. It was red and black and awful looking. It was so brutal."

Starr's injuries played a critical role in Alabama history. As the story notes, coach Harold "Red" Drew lost his star quarterback for most of the season in the fall of 1954. When Drew was fired that November, a "timeline of events" was put into motion that ended with Paul "Bear" Bryant as Alabama's coach in 1957.
