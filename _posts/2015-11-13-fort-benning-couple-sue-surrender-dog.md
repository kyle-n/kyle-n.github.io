A Fort Benning couple is going to court to get their dog back after giving it up at Fort Benning Animal Control.

<!--break-->

R. Edward Furr, their attorney, said he hoped to commence legal action in the Superior Court of Chattahoochee County on Friday.

"We have tried mild and lenient measures," Furr said. "It's pretty clear to us based on what we've learned today that we just have to file suit." {% include footnote num="1" note="Unsurprisingly, both parties told me they feel they have the moral high ground and feel sorry for the other, who are nice people who just got caught up in the wrong thing." %}

The conflict began when 21-year-old Blake Lechner, a specialist in the 3rd Infantry Division, received news that he would be transferred to Korea. The transfer would happen between January and August 2016, according to his wife, Ashley Lechner, 23.

Ashley said the two thought they would have to give up their 1-year-old bulldog named Spot. Blake took the dog to Fort Benning Animal Control on Saturday. Later that day, Ashley said he learned that there was a way to transport his family and dog back to their relatives in Lancaster County, Penn. Because the family could help take care of Spot, they tried to get him back.

Ashley said they tried calling the Tri County Animal Rescue, which handles strays and surrenders for Fort Benning, but received no answer. She said she tried messaging them Sunday morning and was told that she'd have to wait until Monday. On Monday, the couple went to the shelter but did not get their dog back.

"We know that we made a mistake, and we tried to fix that mistake right away," Ashley said.

The Tri County Rescue offers a 12-hour window in which owners who change their mind can take their dogs back. Furr said the Lechners did not receive a fair 12-hour period.

The story, [originally reported by Fox 5 in Atlanta](http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/46939711-story), has sparked a reaction that strikes the employees of the Tri County Rescue as misguided. {% include footnote num="2" note="It looks like Fox 5 tried to get the rescue's side but they did not give it to them at the time. The backlash after the first story definitely changed staffs' minds." %}

"The truth of the whole thing is completely different," said Andrea Hoffman, who works at the shelter.

Hoffman said when Spot was dropped off at the rescue he was shaking, not neutered and not registered on base. Her son, Thomas Hoffman, said the dog's medical records were inaccurate, listing him as neutered when he wasn't.

Thomas Hoffman said the rescue refused to give Spot back because of concerns about his living conditions.

"If they would have come to us as an adopting client, they wouldn't have met the criteria," he said.

Thomas Hoffman cited concerns about letting an intact bulldog back into a family with a 2-year-old and a 3-month-old. He also said the dog was jumpy and not leash trained. He said he feared it got into fights with the Lechners' other dog, a 4-year-old boxer lab mix.

Ashley Lechner said while Spot could be "jumpy," he had never touched their children other than to lick them while giving kisses and never fought with the other dog. She also said they'd be willing to get Spot, a "hyper" dog, the proper medical care and further training.

Thomas Hoffman also disputes that the dog was surrendered because of the Lechners' concerns over a transfer to Korea. He said the form they filled out mentions behavioral issues and nothing about a transfer.

They surrendered the dog because of behavioral concerns, Thomas Hoffman said, adding they tried to get it back because they were embarrassed when neighbors and others found out the dog was at the rescue.

The two parties offer differing versions of other issues as well. Furr said the Tri County Rescue posted a picture of Spot Sunday morning on Facebook offering him up for adoption, just a day after receiving him, in order to make money off of adoption fees.

The post and Facebook page have been deleted because Thomas Hoffman said he and his family received threats.

Thomas Hoffman said the rescue was not motivated by profit, saying that the shelter relies on his father's pension after 27 years in the military.

Ashley Lechner said she realizes the family made a mistake and wants Spot back, even if it means going to court.

"Our family did not want to come to this," Lechner said. "It's not cheap, but for our family this is what we have to do."
