Phenix City police and the U.S. Marshals Service announced the arrest of David Bauman on the 280 bypass in Phenix City on March 22.

According to a release, Bauman was a fugitive wanted in Illinois for failure to register as a sex offender and state probation violation. Police said they found a small amount of methamphetamines during the arrest and charged him accordingly.

Phenix City police said the arrest happened because a “concerned citizen” suspected something was wrong and called the Marshals Service. The police would like to remind people to report suspicious activity to law enforcement agencies.
