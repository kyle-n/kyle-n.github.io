Judge Michael Cielinski held Glenn without bond for the murder charge. He set the bond for possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime at $25,000, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon at $25,000, aggravated assault at $50,000 and possession of marijuana at $500. Cielinski bound the case over to Superior Court.

A dozen members of Barron’s extended family attended the hearing and left the courtroom after Glenn was taken back inside. They called Barron’s death “devastating.”

“Last time I saw him he was going to go to work,” said Sherman Dyous, Barron’s uncle. “I said, 'I’ll see you later,' and that was the last time I saw him.”

Dyous remembered Barron as a friendly, generous person.

“My nephew never wanted to harm anybody,” Dyous said. “He’d give you the shirt off his back.”

Several family members said Barron was shot after Glenn tried to rob him because Barron had just gotten his paycheck from his job at the Kia plant.

Dyous said the two men had been friends since childhood and that he was used to seeing Glenn around the house.

Jaleecia Dowsey was also in court. She had a son with Barron.

“My mom called and said Marcus got shot,” Dowsey said. “I said not Marcus. That ain’t like Marcus… when I got there, my baby was on that stretcher. I just can’t believe it.”

Dowsey paused to collect herself.

“[Our son is] two,” she said. “He doesn’t even understand.”
