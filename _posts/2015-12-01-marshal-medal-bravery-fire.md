Sgt. Kurt Weathered of the Muscogee County Marshals was honored with the department’s first-ever Medal of Bravery at the Government Center Tuesday.

Weathered said he was on his couch at home, recovering from surgery on his Achilles tendon and about to watch “Gunsmoke,” when he saw smoke coming from his neighbor’s house. He said he put his boot on his bad foot and [hopped across the street without crutches into the house]({% post_url 2015-11-25-man-rushes-burning-house %}). He said he was afraid his neighbor Kevin Flowers was asleep inside the burning house.

“We are here because Sergeant Weathered saw the need to lay down his own life and go into a burning house to save the life of his friend and neighbor,” said Muscogee County Marshal Greg Countryman. “He did not know if he would come out of that burning house. This was a very heroic act.”

For his bravery, Weathered received the Medal of Bravery. Countryman said the department has had the award but never given it before.

“We never do anything expecting to get anything in return,” Weathered said. “It means a lot to me.”

Weathered said he tried to open the door by smashing a window with his ASP baton. When he saw the door had a chain on it, he hopped in front of it, stood on his boot and used his good foot to smash open the front door.

A quick search of the living room revealed a collapsing ceiling but not Flowers. Weathered ran back outside, got a flashlight from his wife Angela and went back into the house. He said he kicked down the bedroom door looking for Flowers.

“My heart dropped because I thought he was on the bed,” Weathered said, choking up as he spoke at the ceremony. “He wasn’t.”

When Weathered saw Flowers’ car was not in the garage, he left the house. Flowers told the Ledger-Enquirer he was at the bank at the time.

“I just thank God for giving me the courage not to follow my mind saying, ‘Man, get out of here. It’s hot,’” Weathered said. “Thank god for my training. I’m just glad (Flowers) is safe.”

Weathered said he was also glad to provide a [positive example of public service]({% post_url 2015-10-09-stickers %}) to contrast with [negative news about law enforcement](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/nation-world/article46184715.html).

“It’s good to do some good because that’s what you signed up for,” he said. “The badge that you wear don’t make you a god. It sets you out to be that example and be that one to help when someone’s in need.”
