The National Infantry Museum has completed a $1.8 million renovation of its theater to allow more flexible use of its 289-sear auditorium.

<!--break-->

The NIM will feature "The New American Freedom Train" in the new theater on Dec. 3, 2015. The show will feature Nashville recording artist Tim Maggart with a band and "an inspiring and patriotic multimedia show."

"It's the perfect event for introducing the new theater," said NIM Foundation president Ben Williams. "And it will appeal to our audiences, who share Tim Maggart's appreciation for the military."

The show begins at 7 p.m. on Dec. 3. Admission is free, but guests must reserve tickets in advance by calling (706) 494 - 3708.

The show will take advantage of several renovations, including a new digital projection system. The 6P Christie Laser Projection System is installed in only two other American theaters, according to the NIM's release. The Giant Screen Theater will be the first in the Southeast to use laser projection.

There will also be a new documentary on Dec. 4 called "[Space Next](http://spacenextmovie.com/index.html)" that covers "mankind's pursuit to reach the stars" in addition to a showing of "[The Polar Express 3D](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338348/)."

There will be two showings of "Polar Express" on Saturday, Dec. 5. The release said The Conductor will be back punching golden tickets at select screenings. On Dec. 12, Muscogee Moms will help run two Polar Express Pajama Parties with free holiday crafts for kids.
