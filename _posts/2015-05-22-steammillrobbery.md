Two Columbus men were robbed at gunpoint in the 5000 block of Steam Mill Road, according to a report from police.

The report said the victims were sitting on the curb in the Shirley B. Winston park parking lot when two black males approached them from behind and told them, "Get up, what do you got on you?"

One of the alleged robbers patted them men down while the other pointed a black long-barrel pistol at them, according to police.

The victims said the man with the gun wore a blue tank top and fishing hat, while the one patting them down wore a white T-shirt with orange shorts.

Police said the robbers took one man's car keys and Galaxy S3 cell phone, worth $300 in total.

The victims said the two alleged robbers fled on foot toward Steam Mill Road, though police were unable to find them after searching the area. The case remains under investigation.
