Comedian Steve Harvey and Montgomery businessman Greg Calhoun are reopening a latex plant in Eufaula next year, according to Calhoun.

"We wanted to put people back to work," Calhoun said. "It's a blessed opportunity."

Calhoun, who has been friends with Steve Harvey for 15 years, said the two were interested in Eufaula because it has the only latex plant in the United States.

Eufaula Mayor Jack Tibbs Jr. said the plant now known as Ameritex closed down in 2008 when it lost its contract with USAID producing condoms for AIDS prevention. Tibbs estimated that contract was 95 percent of the plant's business.

Calhoun said he plans to have the factory produce mostly latex gloves for major organizations such as Wal-Mart, the Transportation Security Administration, poultry producers and hospitals.

He said he's already spoken with Rob Walton, chairman of Wal-Mart, who has indicated interest in buying gloves from the factory as part of the retailer's initiative to move jobs back to the United States.

Calhoun said he hopes to have the first two lines operational by January 2016 and the whole plant online in four phases through 2018.

Although Calhoun said it was "nice to have Wal-Mart to start out with," he doesn't plan on having only one major customer like the plant did before.

"(Walton) didn't want to be our only customer," Calhoun said. "He wanted us to get out there and find others."

Calhoun said the output from one line in Ameritex could supply Wal-Mart, leaving several others for different customers.

Jim Bradley, director of economic development for the city of Eufaula, said there are about 10 people working on retooling the four production lines to make them ready to produce latex gloves instead of condoms. He said only one of the four was already set up to do gloves.

Tibbs said there is a great deal of excitement for the plant, which is estimated to bring 300 jobs over two years. Each line will require 65-70 people, plus supervisors, management and warehouse employees.

Bradley said the plant will slowly staff up as more of it comes online. He estimates that 27 people will be working there on Jan. 4, 2016, and 100 by the end of 2016. By 2018, there should be 350 people hired.

"It's a long, complicated process, but Mr. Harvey and Mr. Calhoun have a terrific vision for the future of latex," Bradley said.

Tibbs said he was happy to see jobs returning to Alabama and especially Eufaula.

"(Harvey) can be a serious guy," Tibbs said. "He wants to put people back to work."
