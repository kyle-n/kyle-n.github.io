Update: The armed robbery charge issued against 62-year-old Linda Marshall was dismissed in Recorder's Court in a Thursday morning hearing.

Judge Michael Cielinski dropped the case, because there was a lot hearsay but no witnesses attended the preliminary hearing to testify.

The 37-year-old victim told the court he actually handed the woman the hat when he was selling caps, but Columbus Police Officer Charles Hickman testified that the victim reported the item stolen on the scene.

The replica that appeared to be a pistol was actually a cigarette lighter, Hickman said.

Original Story: A Columbus man was robbed at gunpoint in the 2000 block of Amos Street on Sunday at 8:05 p.m.

Linda Marshall, 62, was arrested and charged with armed robbery in connection with the incident.

According to the report, the suspect pointed a "replica of [a] pistol" at the victim and used it to take a red, white and blue Gametek ball cap worth $4. No one was injured, according to the report.

Police said they have recovered the cap.
