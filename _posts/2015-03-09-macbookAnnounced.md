Apple is doing it again. While the rest of the tech industry is moving toward touch-enabled convertibles, Apple is making a laptop unlike anything we've ever seen before. 

<!--break-->

The new MacBook (no suffix like Air or Pro, because Apple likes confusing us) is a small 12-inch laptop with big aspirations. 

"The definition of portability has changed in the last several years, led by iPhone and iPad," said Apple CEO Tim Cook. "We challenged ourselves by taking everything we'd learned and do something incredibly ambitious and bold. We challenged ourselves to reinvent the notebook, and we did."

## 12-inch Retina MacBook Details

The MacBook is the thinnest and lightest laptop Apple has ever made, with a profile just 13.1 mm high at its thickest end. It uses the same wedge design as the MacBook Air, but with an even greater emphasis on being thin. 

The MacBook is just 2 lbs (or just under 1 kg), even lighter than the 2.38-lb 11-inch MacBook Air. 

On the top end, it sports a 12-inch, 2304 x 1440 Retina Display that puts the old 1440 x 900 Air panel to shame. 

Below that is a redesigned keyboard to better fit the frame. The new keyboard raises the left and right arrow key heigh, as well as the width of the Alt and Esc keys. 

The trackpad has also been redesigned to read presses, not clicks. Instead of being clickable, the new trackpad uses four sensors to read the pressure of your push. 

What Apple calls a "Force Touch" acts as a mix between a right click and something else entirely. When pressing the fast-forward button in Quicktime, greater pressure causes it to fast-forward faster. Force-clicking an item in finder opens Preview. 

The most revolutionary part of the new MacBook, though, is its ports. Just like the rumors said, it doesn't many. There is one USB-C port that acts as a USB port, power plug and driver for external displays. 

No MagSafe, no SD card slot, no DisplayPort. Crazy. 

The battery is rated for 9 hours of web browsing and 10 hours of video on a 1.3GHz fanless processor. The chip can spin up to 2.9GHz in turbo mode. Expect this thing to heat up in turbo. 

The MacBook ships on April 10 for $1299 or $1599 for a faster processor with more storage.
