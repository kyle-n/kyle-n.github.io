A short burst of rain couldn't keep a crowd of veterans and their families from gathering outside the National Infantry Museum on Memorial Day morning to celebrate the addition of 224 new paver stones to its memorial.

"These pavers that are going to go in today tell these stories, and they're going to live long after us," said retired Sgt. Michael Schlitz, the dedication speaker. "They're going to be here for decades and decades to come. What it means to those families and those vets that have those pavers in is unmatched."

The hour-long ceremony was attended by members of the museum's board and officers from Fort Benning, including Maj. Gen. Scott Miller.

According to Ilene Kent, director of dedications for the museum, anyone can buy a paver for any individual or group for a $250 donation to the museum.

Vietnam veteran Andrew Zorbis bought 18 pavers, one for everyone in his unit who went with him to Vietnam.

"This is our 25th year," Zorbis said. "Next year it'll be 50 years since we landed in Vietnam by boat."

Zorbis, who was deployed to and came home from Vietnam with the same group of men, said he feels a "special affinity" for the others.

Henry H. Wilson, an 80-year-old veteran who worked at Fort Benning for 35 years, said he appreciated the ceremony.

"It's good to see so many soldiers out with these pavers," Wilson said.
