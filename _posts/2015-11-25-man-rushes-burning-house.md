A house at the corner of Lantern Lane and Lantern Court caught fire Wednesday afternoon.

<!--break-->

Kevin Flowers, who lives in the house, said he was at the bank for less than an hour when he started getting "a whole lotta calls." He said he does not know why or how the fire began.

Kurt Weatherd, a sergeant in the Muscogee County Marshals, said he called 911 at 12:49 p.m. when he saw a lot of smoke coming from Flowers' house.

Weatherd said he recently had surgery on his achilles tendon and could put a little pressire on his right foot, but not much.

This did not stop Weatherd from going across the street to open Flowers' door and rushing inside to look for him, even when it meant hopping on one leg. He said he had to bust down a few doors with his good leg to check the bedroom and garage.

"My main concern was whether (Flowers) was inside asleep," Weatherd said.

Weatherd, who is ex-military, said he didn't hesitate to go into the burning building.

"Stuff like this, it's our job to run one way when everyone else is running the other," he said. "When you got family, you don't think about yourself."

Battalion Chief Bobby Dutton said it took the fire department an hour to put after it got into the attic.

Dutton said the cause of the fire was still under investigation. He couldn't put a number on the cost of the damages, only that the house was a total loss.

"It's bad that it happened the day before Thanksgiving, but we're just glad nobody got hurt," Dutton said.
