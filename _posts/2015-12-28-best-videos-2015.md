### Video: Police officer body cam shows him shooting suspect

By far the most popular video this year was the raw footage showing a Columbus police officer shooting Towon Earl on Nov. 2. Earl was arrested after injuring three officers when he put his car into drive, [striking two and injuring a third](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article43373514.html). Four different police cameras captured Earl's actions before he was shot. The Columbus Police Department says it is equipping more officers with the cameras in a [three-month test program](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article44944272.html).

### Muscogee County jail officials, inmate get in fight

The Columbus branch of the NAACP [released video](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article29450245.html) in May of a fight that happened on July 13, 2013, between an inmate of Muscogee County Jail and two officers. Christopher Russell, a diabetic, had complained to deputies about his meals arriving late, according to those involved. The two officers who allegedly attacked him, Deputy Anthony Ermi and Correctional Officer Anthony Merritt, were investigated. Ermi was suspended for 36 hours without pay. Merritt was terminated after being charged with an unrelated crime before the investigation was completed.

### Home owners say John 'Rusty' Houser destroyed their house

The gunman who [killed two women and himself in a Louisiana movie theater](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article29489611.html) in July was the same John Russell "Rusty" Houser who [vandalized and bobby-trapped the Phenix City house](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/crime/article29490280.html) a Columbus man bought 18 months ago for his daughter out of foreclosure -- years after they went to church with Houser and considered him incapable of such horror. Norman Bone, 77, and his daughter, Beth Bone, said the 32nd Street home still isn't fit to be occupied a year and a half after police accompanied them to seize the house and evict Houser.
