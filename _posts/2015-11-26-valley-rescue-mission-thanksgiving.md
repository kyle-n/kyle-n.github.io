Volunteers and needy families filled the large white tent by Valley Rescue Mission on Thanksgiving to both give and be served.

“I just really wanted to serve the Lord,” said Kathy Hutto, who drove in from LaGrange to help. “He’s been really good to me lately and I wanted to serve Him.”

Mitzi Oxford, the Mission’s development director, estimates that they served more than 800 people at the tent. The women and children’s center, Damascus Way, also fed everyone at the shelter and delivered meals to more than 300 elderly shut-ins.

The event required more than 100 volunteers, donations from around the community and a great deal of food.

Masterbuilt smoked more than 100 turkeys so the Downtown Rotary Club could de-bone them. Summerville Road Baptist Church delivered desserts, and St. Luke School made the table centerpieces.

Abigail Pritchett, 10, came with her grandparents Christopher and Debbie Kearns from Ellersly to help serve others.

“I just love to see their happy faces,” Pritchett said.

Hutto agreed, calling it “a worthwhile trip.”
