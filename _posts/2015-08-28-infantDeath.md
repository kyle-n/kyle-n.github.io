A LaGrange, Ga., man is facing a murder charge after police said a 4-month-old died in his care, according to a release.

Brandon Heard, 30, was arrested Thursday afternoon and charged with murder and first-degree cruelty to children. He is held in the Troup County Jail.

LaGrange police were called to the 1500 block of Hogansville Road Tuesday around 2:55 p.m. in reference to a child not breathing. Upon arrival, police found 4-month-old Skylar King unresponsive. The infant was taken to the West Georgia Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation conducted an autopsy Wednesday and found Skylar died from blunt-force trauma to the head, according to the release.

Police said the injury was inflicted Tuesday by Heard, the boyfriend of Skylarâ€™s mom. Heard was taking care of the child while the mother was at work, according to the report.

The case remains under investigation.
