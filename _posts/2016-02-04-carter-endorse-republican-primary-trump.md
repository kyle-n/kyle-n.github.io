Jimmy Carter said he would prefer Donald Trump over Ted Cruz for the Republican nominee for president, according to a talk given during a visit to Great Britain's House of Lords.

"I think I would choose Trump, which may surprise some of you," he said to laughter from the crowd, according to a [dispatch](http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/02/03/jimmy-carter-endorses-donald-trump-over-ted-cruz/) from an AJC reporter. "The reason is, Trump has proven already he's completely malleable. I don't think he has any fixed (positions) he'd go to the White House and fight for. On the other hand, Ted Cruz is not malleable. He has far right-wing policies he'd pursue if he became president."

The former Democratic president was speaking there to deliver a lecture on a campaign to eradicate the Guinea worm disease. Carter praised Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for a "remarkable" showing in the Iowa caucus, but said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would still win the nomination. As a Democrat, Carter said he'd ultimately support whoever received the nomination in his party.

Carter also predicted Trump would fade away once people got down to the brass tacks of actually voting for him.

According to [CBS](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jimmy-carter-i-would-choose-donald-trump-over-ted-cruz/), Ted Cruz told supporters in New Hampshire about the former president's remarks.

"I want the video, and I am going to pay to air Jimmy Carter attacking me," Cruz said.

Trump has not responded as of this writing.
