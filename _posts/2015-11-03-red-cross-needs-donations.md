The American Red Cross is encouraging people around Columbus and Phenix City to donate blood during the holidays.

<!--break-->

"A seasonal decline in donations often occurs from Thanksgiving to New Year's Day when donors get busy with family gatherings and travel," a spokeswoman said in a release. "However, patients don't get a holiday vacation from needing lifesaving transfusions."

Everyone who donates between Nov. 25 and Nov. 29 will receive a Red Cross mixing spoon and celebrity chef recipe set while supplies last.

The Red Cross said donors of all blood types are needed, especially those with O-negative, B-negative, A-negative and AB blood. Anyone who would like to donate needs a blood donor card, driver's license or two other forms of identification. You must be at least 17, weigh 110 pounds and be in "generally good health." High school students and other donors 18 and younger may also have to meet "certain height and weight requirements."

To make an appointment to donate blood, download the Red Cross Blood Donor App (Android and iPhone), visit the Red Cross' website or call 1-800-733-2767.
