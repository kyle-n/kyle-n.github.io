Hardaway graduate and former Columbus resident Michelle Ekwoge got the surprise of her life when her name was called during a taping of "The Price is Right."

Ekwoge bought tickets to be in the audience at a taping July 6. The show aired yesterday.

"It's everybody's dream [to be on the show], right?" she asked.

She said she talked to a producer and gave him a hug before the show during a segment. Ekwoge said she did not realize the segment was for the producers to figure out who to call up onto the stage.

"I was just trying to find a way to stand out," Ekwoge said.

Her hug must have worked, because she was called down to be a contestant after the first commercial break.

"I was so excited," she said. "I just wanted to get down there as soon as possible in case they made a mistake."

Ekwoge guessed the price of several items but did not win a round and pass onto a solo contest.

After the show, Ekwoge said she got $300 for her trouble.

"I'll keep it or use it to pay a bill or something," she said, laughing.

Ekwoge said some aspects of attending "The Price is Right" surprised her. She said she saw people who won major prizes like cars and vacations turn down some of them because of the taxes involved. California, where the show is filmed, has a heavy gift tax that can make keeping prizes [an expensive proposition](http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/can-you-afford-free-taxes-spoil-the-game-show-win).

Ekwoge graduated from Hardaway High School in 2007 and Georgia State. She moved to Oakland two years ago and works as an office manager in San Francisco.
