Repairs on the northbound bridge over Upatoi Creek on I-185 will affect traffic starting March 5, according to a release from Fort Benning.

The release said concrete barriers will go up Saturday to control traffic, with construction starting Monday. Traffic will be restricted to one lane in each direction over the southbound bridge.

This phase of construction is expected to take four months, according to the release, which also recommends using alternate routes. The speed limit in the construction zone is 35 miles per hour.
