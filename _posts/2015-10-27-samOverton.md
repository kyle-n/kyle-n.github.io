William Nathan Thomas Daniels died too soon.<!--break--> The 23-year-old Phenix City resident ran off Randolph County Road 82 at 6 a.m. and [struck an embankment](http://www.al.com/news/anniston-gadsden/index.ssf/2015/10/phenix_city_man_killed_when_ve.html). He was pronounced dead at the scene by Alabama state troopers.

The loss of the beloved son, older brother and boyfriend turned his loved ones' world upside down.

Overton said she met Daniels at his house in Phenix City on June 14, 2015.

"It was instant," she said. "He told me within the first week we were soulmates. I thought he was crazy. I just shrugged it off... [but] it didn't take me long before I realized he was onto something."

Overton and Daniels connected over a shared love of travel and music. They loved discovering new bands together and sharing them with the other person. They had already booked a hotel and bought tickets to a Zeds Dead concert in Nashville in November.

Overton said the two wanted to wait to have kids until their 30s so they could travel the world. They made plans to go to Europe the following year. Daniels, an Army brat who moved around the world, spent three years in Baumholder, Germany, when he was a baby and wanted to visit again.

The couple had planned to rent a house in LaGrange in February. They'd already picked out a favorite.

Overton said she loved Daniels' passion for life, travel, music and his small circle of close friends.

"If he loved you, then you knew it," Overton said. "He gave it his all in everything."

Overton said when she collected his possessions after the wreck, she pressed play on his Galaxy S6 and received a shock.

"It was in the middle of a song... it was our band," she said. "The whole band was about love and passion and that one song was about losing that love. It was just bone-chilling."

Overton said she wants to make sure William Nathan Thomas Daniels is remembered. She is planning a cross-country road trip with his ashes. Daniels' father Tom Daniels said he hopes he can go for some of the trip, if circumstances allow.

Overton's plan starts with renting a car and driving out to El Paso, Texas, where Daniels lived. After that, Las Vegas and Fort Irvin, Calif., where Daniels was born. From there she'll drive up to Portland, Ore., and Seattle, where one of Daniels' friends lives.

She's running a [GoFundMe drive](https://www.gofundme.com/r76j58ws) to help collect money for the trip. If Overton raises enough, she is thinking about flying to Germany and spending time in Europe. She said they had planned to go to Italy next summer. She'd love to see the country and backpack around as much as possible. Overton does not plan to leave until next spring break, so the plans are still in motion.

Overton said she's also applied for as many overtime shifts as is legally possible at her job as a lab assistant at Columbus Regional Medical Center. It helps save money for the trip and keep her mind off of her loss.

"I just want to go as many places as I possibly can," Overton said. "It is my last gift to him. It's something I want to do to make sure he's remembered. I don't want him to just go away. I don't want him to just sit up on a shelf and collect dust. I want him to be where his heart wanted to be."
