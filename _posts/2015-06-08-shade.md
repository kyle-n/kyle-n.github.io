Few things bother me as much as a messy desktop. Logging onto someone else's computer or a shared machine and seeing items scattered across the desktop bothers me. It bothers me on a level few other things to on PCs, except [WiFi that keeps disconnecting](http://www.technorms.com/44679/fix-wifi-trouble-mac-os). It's hard to concentrate and [it slows down your Mac](http://lifehacker.com/5893054/an-overly-cluttered-desktop-can-seriously-slow-down-your-mac--clean-it-up-for-a-noticeable-speed-boost).

To clean up your desktop, you could go through and manually delete everything you don't need... or try using Shade. Shade is a program literally built to clean up out-of-control Mac desktops. That's how bad the problem is, is that we need a program to do this stuff for us. 

## How to Clean Your Mac's Desktop in One Click

Here's how you can clean your Mac's desktop in one click (not counting the clicks necessary to download the app and get it all set up). 

You can get a free trial of Shade off the [developer's website](http://www.limitpointstore.com/products/shade/) by clicking "Download" below the "Buy" button. If you're interested in the full version, [it's $10 on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/shade/id546881298?mt=12). 

Shade is simple but effective. It drops a screen over your desktop, covering up all the clutter with a new background that is blissfully empty.

Technically, this is dodging the problem altogether, since the items are still there on your desktop. However, it does provide some much-needed relief with a single click on its menu bar icon. 

That's about it as far as features go. Shade doesn't do anything else other than dropping an icon-free screen over your desktop. 

It's a nice band-aid for the problem of too many icons, though it doesn't solve the issue of slowing down your Mac as well. Can't have everything... fixing that means going through and sorting that stuff into folders. 

Shade fits into OS X fairly well, though there are some seams if you look hard enough. Cmd-Mission Control (the show desktop shortcut) pushes the Shade off the screen as well to show the real desktop. Mission Control makes the Shade vanish and the real desktop appears in the background. 

You can't drop items onto the desktop when the Shade is active. Pulling down the Shade on one desktop doesn't do the same on other virtual desktops. 

Still, Shade is a great example of simple, elegant program design. It does what it does and nothing more. Its energy impact, as measured in Activity Monitor, is minimal. 

### Final Thoughts

Honestly, $10 is a little excessive for a program as bare-bones as shade. However, it is a decent way to temporarily clear the clutter on a Mac desktop, especially for people who are bad about clearing it out and let that stuff build up in the first place. 

Definitely give the [free trial](http://www.limitpointstore.com/products/shade/) a shot before spending $10 on this. If you're the right kind of clutterbug, you'll love it.
