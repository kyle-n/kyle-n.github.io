More than four weeks after Capt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver became [the first women to graduate from Ranger School](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/military/article31334486.html), Griest is one of several soldiers featured in an advertisement for the Army.

The photo is part of a montage showing her carrying another soldier. You can see it 6 seconds into the video.

The picture was taken at Fort Benning on April 20 during close arms combat training in Ranger School by Spc. Nikayla Shodeen.
