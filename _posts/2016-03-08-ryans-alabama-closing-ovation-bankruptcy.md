Ryan's buffets closed across Alabama Sunday. From [AL.com](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/03/ryans_apparently_no_long_on_me.html#incart_most-commented_opinion_article):

> The Ryan's locations in Gardendale, Tuscaloosa, Cullman, and Prattville were closed Sunday, according to a statement from the spokesperson for Buffets, LLC.

The site said it was able to confirm that the Ryan's at 2301 S. McKenzie Street in Foley, Ala., is open as of 11 a.m. Tuesday, so there is at least one operating in the state.

The shutdowns come after the Ryan's on Manchester Expressway was [closed without warning last month]({% post_url 2016-02-04-ryans-manchester-expressway-close-down %}). Vice president of development for Ovation Brands (a parent company of Ryan's) Peter Donbavand said at the time closing stores would help stabilize the company's performance.

"We know that these decisions are not easy," he said in the statement. "However, we strongly believe that this direction is best for the long-term health of all brands."

Food Management Partners acquired Ovation Brands in August 2015. Donbavand said one parent company of Ryan's, Buffets LLC, is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to strengthen its business through restructured debt and fewer weak restaurants.

"The Chapter 11 filing is prompted by the discovery of liabilities, or alleged liabilities, that we believe were not disclosed in our negotiations," Donbavand said. "We intend to investigate the propriety of the disclosures, and intend to consult with our counsel regarding any remedies we may have."
