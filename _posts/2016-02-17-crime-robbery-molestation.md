### Court: 13-year-old molested by man close to family

A Columbus man was arrested last week on multiple counts of child molestation, according to police.

Detective Amanda Hogan testified in court Monday morning that Freddie Williams was charged with one count of aggravated child molestation, two counts of child molestation and one count of enticing a child for indecent purposes.

According to Hogan, two mothers saw the victim, a 13-year-old girl, leave the bus stop one morning before going to school. They followed her as the girl traveled toward Rigdon Road. The mothers, Hogan said, found the girl in the men’s rest room of Rigdon Park.

The mothers said they saw a man following the 13-year-old to the park, police said, but he fled when he saw the two women.

Hogan said the victim identified Williams as that man in an interview. She told the court the victim said Williams called her phone and asked her to meet him in the park. The victim left the bus stop because she did not want Williams to come to the stop, according to testimony.

The detective said Williams was homeless but had been staying a family member’s home since November 2015. Hogan also said Williams had been molesting the girl since that same month.

Police said a relative of the victim once walked in on Williams having sex with her and did not stop them or report the incident to the police, for which he was charged with reckless conduct last week, Hogan said.

Hogan said she had not had a chance to speak with Williams. He did not give a statement in court.

Recorder’s Court Judge Michael Cielinski held Williams without bond for the aggravated child molestation charge, set each non-aggravated molestation charge at $50,000 apiece and the enticement charge at a $25,000 bond. He then bound the case over to Superior Court.
