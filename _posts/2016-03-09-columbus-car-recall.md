Columbus earned the dubious honor of being the city in Georgia with the highest rate of cars on the road with recalled parts, according to a release from Carfax.

"A large part of that is due to people not doing enough to stay informed on recalls on their cars," said Carfax public relations manager Chris Basso. "If they do find out their vehicle has a recall, they're not taking action on those notices and taking them into the dealer to be fixed."

Basso said 19 percent of cars on the road in Columbus had at least one unfixed safety recall, one percent higher than the Georgia state average.

Drivers interested in checking whether their car has a recalled part can go to [Carfax's website](https://www.mycarfax.com/), which will look up any recalls based on a vehicle's license plate.

Basso recommended SUV and minivan owners in particular check for recalls because those types of vehicles have the greatest chance of having an unfixed recall.

"The thing that's alarming about that is SUVs and minivans are family-oriented vehicles," Basso said. "We're taking our kids around every day; we're driving those vehicles to and from work."

Anyone who has a recall something in their car, Basso said, should immediately contact a local dealer and take it in to be fixed. The fix is often free and can take only a day.

"If everybody does their small part, then this problem is going to be significantly reduced, especially in Columbus, and it makes Columbus roads that much safer," Basso said.
