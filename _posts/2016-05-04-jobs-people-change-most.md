According to public data, people don’t work the same food service job for very long. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks how long people spend at a given job in several industries. They found that among certain fields, employees tended to have been at their current job for less time than in others.

For example, people working in laundry and arts and entertainment had some of the shortest time on a single job of most industries. Such job hopping bear a toll on the companies in these industries. [One survey](http://www.ajc.com/news/business/the-cost-of-millennials-job-hopping/nZKJC/) found 87 percent of companies said it cost $15,000 to $25,000 to replace a departed employee.

Workers in these industries may change positions because of a [lack of advancement](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/employee-turnover-statistics-restaurants-16744.html) and poor working conditions. They're not alone, either. These days the average American has [7.2 jobs by 28](http://www.ajc.com/news/news/national/average-american-has-jobs-28/nq4MM/).
