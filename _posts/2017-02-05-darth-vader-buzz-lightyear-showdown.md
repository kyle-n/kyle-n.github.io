Ever wonder what would happen if “Star Wars” crossed over with “Toy Story”? This fan-made film by YouTube channel Nukazooka is the best answer we’ll get until Disney decides to actually do this. C’mon, Mouse House! It would be amazing to see a Darth Vader action figure inside the next “Toy Story” movie.

Until then, consider this video canonical proof of what would happen if the Darth Vader and Buzz Lightyear fought.

As you can tell from the dreary backgrounds, the four-and-a-half-minute video is a fan project. To its credit, the special effects are excellent and the film doesn’t pull its punches and declare a tie.

There is a definite winner, and it is the character you’d think would come out on top.
