Auburn graduate and Opelika resident Jessica Mills recently completed a hike of 2,189.2 miles along the Appalachian Trail from Springer Mountain, Ga., to Mount Katahdin in Maine.

[The Auburn Plainsman](http://www.theplainsman.com/article/2015/12/local-woman-completes-2189-2-mile-hike-from-georgia-to-maine) reported Mills' trip, which began at Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia on March 29. Mills told The Plainsman she planned to hike it in 2012 but took a job in Colorado instead. After returning to Auburn in the fall of 2014, she tackled the trail.

"When Jessica left for the trail, I was naturally afraid for her safety," said her mother Rhonda. "Although I would have felt better if she wasn't starting out by herself, I knew she would soon make friends and wouldn't be hiking alone for long."

Mills kept a journal along the trail, recording her thoughts in [text](http://homemadewanderlust.com/cross-the-line/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhqmV26773qZhzqJz4VFcw). She has a great eye for capturing the local color in an area. It's worth reading for anyone curious about the experience.

Mills recommended hiking the trail to any Auburn student.

"You're going to be an expert at hanging a bear bag because you have so much experience throwing paper towel rolls," she said.
