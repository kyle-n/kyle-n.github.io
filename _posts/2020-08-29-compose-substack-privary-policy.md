title: Compose for Substack privacy policy
---

Compose for Substack uses the bare minimum of your Substack information in order to function. 

## Information NOT stored:

**Password**: Compose uses your password, if you have one, only to retrieve the cookie Substack uses to authenticate create/edit post requests. Your password is not and will never be stored. 

**Email contents**: The contents of your email newsletters and your account information is also not stored or tracked in any way. 

**Subscriber list**: The app does not access or track your subscriber list in any way. 

## Information Compose DOES store:

Everything on this list is stored **locally** and will never be shared with outside parties.

**Cookie**: Upon login, Substack uses a cookie to authenticate requests to create and edit posts. Compose locally stores this cookie so you can create and edit posts in the app. 

**Substack sub-domain**: Some operations, such as creating or scheduling posts, require sending a request to that newsletter's specific sub-domain. Compose stores the sub-domain of your newsletter in order to create, edit and schedule posts. 

**Email**: Compose stores your email address locally in order to:

* Prefill the "Send Test Email" field, so you can send test emails to yourself
* Track how many posts are left in your free trial

Your email will never be shared with an outside party or spammed.

**Substack Author ID**: Compose locally stores your author ID number in order to create new posts. 

## My app's promise

Let me be clear. I am not interested in any kind of gross business model involving selling users' personal information.

I want Compose to be the absolute best writing experience possible so you will *want* to subscribe. To my mind, a great writing experience means never having to worry if you are the product. 

With Compose, direct user support means there's no skeezy middleman. It means everyone's interests are aligned - you want a great writing app, and I want to earn your subscription by delivering a great writing app.
