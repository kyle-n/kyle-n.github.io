[Goop](https://goop.com/), the lifestyle brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, has a [history](http://people.com/bodies/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-deceptive-health-claims/) of [promoting](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-doctors_us_5968f1a5e4b03389bb16f758) controversial [products](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4984790/Gwyneth-Paltrow-s-Goop-wins-worst-pseudoscience-award.html).

Last Thursday, however, a Goop newsletter [included](https://goop.com/wellness/detox/the-beauty-wellness-detox-guide/?ref=newsletter&irgwc=1&utm_campaign=10079_Online%20Tracking%20Link&utm_source=impactradius&utm_medium=affiliate&irgwc=1&utm_campaign=10079_Online%20Tracking%20Link&utm_source=impactradius&utm_medium=affiliate)something notable even by that standard in its “full detox package”: the Implant O-Rama System At-Home Coffee Enema for $135. 

Goop promoted a DIY kit for a user to insert coffee into his or her own rectum.

An enema is something doctors may recommend to people about to undergo a colonoscopy or who have obstructed bowels. It involves pushing water through a tube into the patient’s rectum to stimulate the intestines and empty everything in there. 

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/01/06/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-promotes-a-135-coffee-enema-kit/#579be6c33229), “Most doctors don't typically recommend using enemas unless you have a problem moving your stools or need to get your colon ready for a procedure.”

Most enemas use saline solution, milk and molasses or sodium phosphate. Scott Gavura, a pharmacist writing at [Science-based Medicine](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/ask-the-science-based-pharmacist-what-are-the-benefits-of-coffee-enemas/), said, “Coffee enemas are considered unsafe and should be avoided.”

[The Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/goop-enema-kit_us_5a4e6fffe4b089e14db95d6c) found evidence of [multiple deaths](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/371881?redirect=true) related to coffee enemas, and at least one case where the individual doing the coffee enema used water that was too hot and suffered [rectal burns](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0029-1215312) (she recovered after a few weeks).

It also linked to a letter in The American Journal of Gastroenterology that said there have been at least three cases of a gastrointestinal syndrome, [proctocolitis](https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/proctitis.htm), related to coffee enemas.

There is no evidence coffee enemas “detox” users, because scientists say [there is no such thing as “detoxing.”](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/detox-what-they-dont-want-you-to-know/)
