Georgia state government is the 24th-least corrupt in the nation, [according to the Center for Public Integrity](http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/09/18367/georgia-gets-d-grade-2015-state-integrity-investigation), a nonprofit investigative journalism group. The rating is an improvement from three years ago when the state was rated dead last on a different scale.

The Center praised 2013's Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Act, which limited gifts to individual lawmakers at $75.

"Lawmakers and lobbyists are adjusting to the new reality," the report said. "For the most part, the swanky steak dinners and “educational” golfing trips have been replaced by more modest expenditures."

However, the law does not require state employees to register as lobbyists. This allows members of the government, such as employees at public universities, to lobby lawmakers without being subject to the $75 gift limit. State employees can give football tickets to politicians, for example.

"You can't get tickets to the Falcons, but [the University of Georgia] can say here are tickets to the president's box," said UGA political science professor Charles Bullock.

Georgia also earned poor marks for a weak ethics agency and restricting access to what should be open records.

"Georgia's shortcomings in oversight and accountability pose a continued risk for corruption and unethical conduct in state government, and the State Integrity Investigation shows that improvements over the past few years are largely incremental," the Center said.

[Alabama](http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/09/18322/alabama-gets-d-grade-2015-state-integrity-investigation) actually earned the seventh-highest place on the list with a D+ ranking. Its grade was brought down by the widespread and rampant corruption among its politicians.

"Two of Alabama’s past six governors have been convicted while in office and sent to prison, one on a bribery conviction he still is appealing and the other for appropriating inaugural campaign funds for personal use," the Center said.

Alabama's rating also dropped because of the trial of Auburn representative and Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard. Hubbard, after championing an ethics law, was charged with 23 felonies under that same law.
