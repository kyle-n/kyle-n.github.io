Google has announced its plan to start a new wireless carrier called Google Fi. The search giant released details today on its website explaining the price, compatibility and rollout of its new networks. 

<!--break-->

"Similar to our Nexus hardware program, Project Fi enables us to work in close partnership with leading carriers, hardware makers, and all of you to push the boundaries of what's possible," Google wrote on its [blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/04/project-fi.html). 

The move comes after long rumors the company would move into the carrier space to offer its own mobile data experience. While it likely will not upend American cell carriers today, Google Fi does some interesting things that have a lot of promise to shake up the stale world of wireless carriers. 

## What Is Google Fi?

Google Fi is the next logical step in Google's quest to provide an end-to-end cell phone experience. It is a new wireless network that marries towers from Sprint, T-Mobile and certified WiFi networks. 

The idea is Google Fi user would stay on a WiFi network Google's certified, or even something like your home or work network. When you leave, the phone seamlessly switches over to an LTE wireless network. Google claims it won't even interrupt your phone call. 

Sprint and T-Mobile are interesting choices for wireless partners for Google Fi as they use completely different wireless bands. Sprint is a CDMA carrier, and T-Mobile uses GSM. In theory, the two non-overlapping network types should provide better coverage. 

### What's Different About Google Fi?

Apart from the pricing (more on that in a minute), Project Fi is basically your phone in the cloud. 

When you sign up, your Nexus 6 can send and receive SMS/MMS/calls like any phone. However, you can opt in to route all of that through Hangouts and receive SMS/MMS/calls/Hangouts on any device running Hangouts. 

Since Hangouts is on everything, this is a dream setup. Imagine being able to take calls and texts on your Android tablet, Windows desktop and Mac laptop. 

Fi will support SMS, MMS, group messaging and visual voicemail. You can even port your old Google Voice number. 

### Can I Use It?

Probably not. The only supported phone is the Nexus 6. Unless you are a serious Android geek and bought one, you can't use Google Fi. The good news is that you don't have to buy a new phone- all Nexus 6es already support the new networks. 

Google says the Nexus 6 is the only phone that supports its "unique SIM" that accesses the different network types. 

As for supporting other phones, Google's [FAQ page](http://fi.google.com/about/faq/#supported-devices-6) said the company plans to support only the Nexus 6 during Project Fi's Early Access phase. 

The Nexus 6 costs $649-$699 for the 32 and 64 GB models from the [Play Store](https://store.google.com/product/nexus_6?utm_source=google-com-nexus&utm_medium=index&utm_campaign=nexus-6). It's an unlocked phone with no subsidies, so it isn't cheap. 

Google Fi is also invite-only at this point. You can [request an invite](https://fi.google.com/signup), but no guarantees at this point. 

Google says it'll send out a small number of invites every week and you'll hear back from them within 30 days. It says it'll prioritize the limited invites based on network access, area and request order. 

### How Much Does Project Fi Cost?

Project Fi keeps plans simple with just one option. You pay $20/month for talk, text, WiFi tethering and international coverage. After that each GB of data is $10/month. 

In a particularly consumer-friendly move, the company will also credit you in full for any data not used. 

"Let's say you go with 3GB for $30 and only use 1.4GB one month. You'll get $16 back, so you only pay for what you use," the company [wrote](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/04/project-fi.html). 

### Where Is Google Fi Available?

This is the impressive bit. Google is launching Project Fi across the country. There's 3G everywhere but Montana and 4G LTE everywhere east of Texas and on the California coast. 

Google has a [full coverage map](https://fi.google.com/coverage) available so you can check your location's coverage. 

### Wait, Google Wants Me to Text on Public WiFi?

Yes. The FAQ page says a Fi-enabled Nexus 6 will automatically route your traffic through a VPN when connecting to public WiFi.

A VPN is like a private tunnel for your internet traffic. It's an excellent way to keep phones and PCs secure from government and ISP snoopers. 

### Will This Succeed?

It's hard to say how successful Google Fi will be. Google has abandoned potentially revolutionary products before (see: Google Voice until today). It can be too scattershot at times. 

This program also faces a Nexus 6-sized bottleneck. That phone was never incredibly popular even among Android superfans because of its massive size and massive price. Fi will never become mainstream if it keeps the Nexus 6 requirement. 

And yet I'd love for this to succeed. Wireless carriers have sat on their laurels for too long and left the innovating to others. 

I also love the idea of putting SMS and phone data in the cloud. Apple has been flirting with the concept by putting SMS and calling into iMessage and Facetime, respectively, but Google's gone even further. 

Google put the phone into the cloud. That's awesome. I love the idea of a future where I can text and call from any device. It's definitely a step up from Apple's vision, which gives you that future so long as you use all Apple products. 

The future isn't entirely Apple-owned, though, and Google understands that. It understands why it's an amazing feature to have calling and texting on Fi through Hangouts for Windows. Google gets it. 

Google Fi is a tremendously promising service. We will watch it closely as it rolls out in the coming years.
