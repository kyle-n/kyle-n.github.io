The city put together a short dramatic reenactment of a few employees deciding when to do holiday garbage pickup.

We could poke fun at the video or the acting, but that would be mean. Honestly, it was funny and got me to pay attention to garbage pickup schedules. It worked.

Next year, the city needs to step it up a notch. The garbage pickup people seem nice enough, but we need to watch them get tough on people who don't follow the new pickup schedule. 

Picture this: garbage collectors pick up trash on Monday and Tuesday next year and send a small team around on Thursday or Friday. Anyone who leaves their trash out on the wrong date has to pay a turkey tax from their Thanksgiving dinner like this:

That video would be even more entertaining.

For next week (Nov. 23-27), the city will collect no yard waste. Thursday's pickup will be on Monday and Friday's will be on Tuesday of that week.
