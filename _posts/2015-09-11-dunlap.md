Columbus Police testified in Recorder's Court Friday that Jasper D. Dunlap, 22, was arrested after a foot chase.

An officer said when he approached a group outside Wilson Apartments at 3400 8th Ave. on possible loitering charges, Dunlap took off running. Police said they caught him after a foot chase.

By the time the chase ended, the other members of the group had already disappeared, according to the officer.

Dunlap, who police said gave a false name, was identified at Muscogee County Jail as being someone on probation and who had an outstanding warrant for theft by taking a motor vehicle, according to testimony.

He pleaded not guilty to charges of loitering, obstructing a law enforcement officer, theft by taking a motor vehicle, violation of probation and giving false information to an officer.

Judge Michael Cielinski set his bond at $1,000 for obstruction, $500 for false information and a 30-day suspended sentence. He then bound the case over to state court.
