Tiny houses are closer than ever to being a reality in Atlanta.  

<!--break-->

Last week, the Atlanta City Council voted on and approved an amendment to city zoning laws allowing “accessory dwelling units.”

Local advocacy group Tiny House Atlanta [called it](https://www.facebook.com/tinyhouseatlanta/photos/a.287123754817991.1073741828.280312608832439/625018347695195/?type=3) “a great step in the right direction.” 

The amendment affects R-5 (two-family residential) zoning, which [Atlanta Magazine found](http://www.atlantamagazine.com/homeandgarden/tiny-houses-now-allowed-atlanta-sort/) include areas in Grant Park, Old Fourth Ward, Edgewood, Candler Park and Inman Park. 

The [language in the amendment](http://atlantacityga.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=1&ID=1904&Inline=True) (starts on page 1360) carves out space for accessory dwelling units of larger main structures. A tiny house counts as one of these secondary units if it is less than 750 square feet and has its own kitchen. 

[Curbed](https://atlanta.curbed.com/2017/5/3/15525700/tiny-house-atlanta-construction-permitted-duplex-r-5) pointed out the amendment also allows “accessory dwelling units without off-street parking on parcels without a curbcut or parcels without off-street parking,” making the affected areas more attractive to car-less Atlantans. 

While the change sets out possibilities for tiny houses that are satellites of existing homes, it does not allow for standalone tiny homes on their own lots. The new language specifically prohibits subdividing accessory units from the primary house. 

It also says nothing about tiny homes on wheels. Many tiny home owners make their homes into RVs, which subject them to a whole separate set of rules.

Still, tiny house advocates said they are happy with the changes. 

“The sky’s the limit to what’s possible,” Atlanta city councilman Kwanza Hall, the bill’s sponsor, told Atlanta magazine. “It’s just up to us as a community to figure out what we want to do, what we envision in the future, and opening up as many possibilities as we can dream up.”
