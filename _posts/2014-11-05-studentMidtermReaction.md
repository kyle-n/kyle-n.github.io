Students of both political parties made their voices heard in the elections Tuesday, Nov. 4.

Morgan Giddens, chairman of the Auburn College Republicans and senior in accounting, volunteered for Speaker Mike Hubbard, R-Auburn.

"We were ecstatic with the result and it turned out to be a great night," Giddens said.

Giddens said working on Hubbard's campaign gave him an example of how a good campaign is run, should he decide to run for office one day.

"Door knocking can be kind of awkward," Giddens said.

David Sandefer, senior in political science, added his view of the night.

"It's a great night to be a Republican," Sandefer said.

Harrison Mills, former SGA president and graduate student in accounting, said he supported Hubbard not necessarily because Hubbard is Republican.

"I believe in state legislators who support the higher education partnership and try to send more money to Auburn University and other higher education institutions in the state," Mills said.

Alicia Valenti, member of the Auburn College Democrats and senior in public administration, said she was disappointed with Republican victories.

"I honestly don't think that much is going to change now that the Republicans have taken control of the Senate," Valenti said. "For the past two years the Republicans in the Senate have been blocking everything that the Democrats do."

David Earnhardt, junior in industrial engineering, volunteered for Hubbard's opponent Shirley Scott-Harris, D-Auburn, and said he was disappointed with the results.

"Your heart sinks a little bit, but at the same time, you're glad you (volunteered), and you move on," Earnhardt said.

Reed Dudley, social director of the Auburn College Democrats and junior in anthropology, worked on staff for Joe Hubbard's campaign, Democratic candidate for Attorney General.

Dudley said she was sad, but proud of how the Democratic candidates performed.

"We gave it our all, it's just Alabama is a red state, (and) that's how it's going to be," Dudley said. "If anything, I think this election shows that Democrats across the state need to turn out on Election Day, because these Republicans winning again, that's what happens when you don't vote."
