Columbus fire and emergency services put out a house fire early Saturday morning near the corner of 12th Avenue and 32nd Street.

A home at 1206 12th Ave. caught fire sometime after 7 a.m., according to Capt. Mary Simonton. She couldn't estimate the time of the call to emergency services, but said fire engine 2 was there within three minutes.

The blaze had subsided and firefighters were spraying down the house by approximately 8:30 a.m.

Simonton said there were no major injuries, though a firefighter injured his ankle on the scene.

Sabine James, a neighbor who's been friends with the house's residents for 25 years, said she was just thankful no one was hurt.

"Everybody got out alive," James said. "The rest can be replaced."

Sgt. Lance Christenson said the fire spread into the front living room and attic before it was put out, causing an estimated $40,000 worth of damage. The fire department is treating the case as an accident and does not plan to investigate further, Christenson said.

Sharon Dunbar, who lives in the home, said her house had burned down before on Christmas Day in 2000.

For now, Dunbar said she plans to stay with family until she figures out what to do next.

"I have no clue [what's next]," Dunbar said.
