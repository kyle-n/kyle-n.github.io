If you haven't already carved your pumpkin, you only have a couple more days left to dig out those seeds.

<!--break-->

Halloween is Saturday and there are numerous things going on around town for your fall festival pleasure.

Trick-or-treat times in the area vary a little: Columbus 6-9 p.m., Phenix City 5:30-8:30 p.m., Fort Benning 6-8 p.m. and Hamilton 5-7 p.m.

Of course, be careful crossing the streets if you're out asking for candy. Drivers, be wary of kids and keep an eye out especially when it gets dark.

Here are some Halloween events going on in the area. If we're missing any, email me at knazario@ledger-enquirer.com and I'll add it.
