Police said Amanda Suzanne Carter, 23, was a passenger in a 2007 Nissan Altima driven by Salena Kathleen Stephens, 24.

The Altima side-swiped a 2012 Ford driven by Tiffany Rena Hill, a 23-year-old Troy woman, according to police. The troopers said the Altima then struck a 2005 Jeep Wrangler driven by Justin Tyler Jacobs, a 31-year-old Rutledge man.

Pike County Coroner Jerry Williams pronounced Carter dead at the scene, according to the release. Police said the four children in the Altima and Jacobs were transported to local hospitals for non-life-threatening injuries. Hill and Stephens were not injured, according to the release.

Police said they are still investigating.
