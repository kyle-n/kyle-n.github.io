Today's news to watch includes a special election for Alabama residents and an address from Mayor Teresa Tomlinson on the state of the city. Here are some stories to keep an eye on during the day.

### The State of City speech

Mayor Teresa Tomlinson will present her [fifth State of the City address](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/article55289805.html) Tuesday during a luncheon held by the Greater Columbus Chamber of Commerce at the Columbus Convention and Trade Center.

In past State of the City addresses, Tomlinson has spoken of accomplishments in her administration’s past and plans for the city’s future. This year she may touch on thawing the "tax freeze" and the city's budget. We could also see some more results from the city's [program to reduce jail population](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/article45294375.html), a system the Ledger-Enquirer editorial board [approves of.](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/opinion/article51941870.html)

### Phenix City special election

After the [sad passing of Lesley Vance](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article42725541.html) last November, three Republicans are [vying to take his place](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article55235195.html) to represent District 80 in the Alabama House of Representatives. Today is the vote between civil engineer James McGill, Phenix City councilman Chris Blackshear and Russell County School Board representative Tommy Pugh. Polls will be open 8 a.m.-8 p.m. EST in Phenix City and Smiths Station.

Should no candidate get more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will coincide with Alabama's March 1 primaries, which may confuse voters again as two separate elections coincide.
