Henry has been one of the Crimson Tide's strengths this year. He scored the winning touchdown in the final three minutes against Tennessee.

Coach Nick Saban singled Henry out as [one of the hardest workers on the team and a leader](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article29437186.html).

"I think that he has a real burning desire to be a really, really good player and works really hard at it," Saban said.

Saban has been [carefully protecting Henry](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/sports/college/sec/university-of-alabama/article31234481.html) to make sure the running back stays healthy. Henry has been [in and out of practice](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/sports/college/sec/university-of-alabama/article36344769.html) intermittently all season, though his teammates say he has an incredible work ethic when he is allowed to practice.

"I just want to make everybody better around me and just get them to push themselves because I'm going to give it my all every time I'm out there," Henry told reporters earlier this year. "Just putting a lot of pressure on myself being that leader. When I go out there, I've got to work and not play and be about what I say I'm going to do."
