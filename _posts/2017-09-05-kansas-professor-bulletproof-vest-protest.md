Kevin Willmott made headlines when he returned to class this year wearing a bulletproof vest. 

<!--break-->

Willmott, a professor for the University of Kansas, said he wanted to protest the state’s law allowing concealed carry on college campuses. The law was passed in 2013 but wasn’t implemented at universities across Kansas until this summer. 

“One of the things I told (students) was, ‘You try to ignore that I’m wearing a bulletproof vest, and I’ll try to ignore that you could be packing a .44 magnum,’” Willmott said. 

Willmott told the Washington Post he thought campus carry was a “crazy idea.” 

“We've seen what happened in these horrible incidences at Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech and a bunch of places around the country," he said. "And I don't think it's the students' job to turn into Rambo try to take on somebody that might be out to do us harm... The whole idea is just insane and it can only lead to bad things.” 

Gov. Nathan Deal [signed campus carry](http://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-governor-signs-campus-gun-measure/f02kSvtstlOhpUhniiyxxO/) into Georgia law in May, allowing college students and others to bring concealed weapons onto campuses. The new rules [still proved cumbersome to gun owners](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/campus-carry-attracts-opinions-but-problems-school-opens/k8bJecouDoY8Pc4DygVJOJ/), however, by requiring tailgaters at the University of Georgia game to store their weapons securely before entering the stadium.
