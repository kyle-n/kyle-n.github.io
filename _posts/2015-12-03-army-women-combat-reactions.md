Women are joining men on the front lines of combat, and some people in Columbus are okay with that.

<!--break-->

An informal poll revealed support for [the decision](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/nation-world/article47724225.html#storylink=mainstage), with a few qualifications.

“Women should be allowed to do anything that they can,” said Margie Watson, of Columbus.

Watson said she hopes the military holds men and women to the same standards and doesn’t change them just because women are allowed in combat positions. She said she was also concerned about the physical ability of women to fight on the frontlines because they are not as strong as men “for the most part.”

Bob Manzi, who was visiting from Denver, said he could think of a few women who were strong enough to meet the combat standards.

“I work out twice a day, five days a week, and some of the women [in the gym] are impressive,” Manzi said. “If they want to do it and they can do it, that’s great.”

Manzi said he supported the decision and would not change anything about it. He pointed to the [first three women to graduate Ranger School](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/military/article39389271.html) as an example of what female soldiers can do if given the opportunity.

Ashley Meadows, a master’s student in history at Columbus State, said she approved of opening combat positions to women.

“This is a huge, huge step,” she said. “It is equal to women earning the right to vote.”

Meadows qualified her support as well, citing concerns about physiology.

“We are built different,” she said. “There’s no denying that one.”

However, Meadows said she expected female soldiers would overcome physical limitations through training.

Lester Mahone said he did not approve of women being on the front lines. He told the Ledger-Enquirer it would be better to keep them in non-combat support roles.

“It’s too dangerous for a woman,” he said. “It’s really not a lady thing. It’s not.”

His wife Lisa Mahone agreed.

“Let the men do the fighting,” she said. “We need our women out here to help our men.”
