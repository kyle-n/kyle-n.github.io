[AL.com](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/03/woman_abducted_outside_trussvi.html) reported that the incident happened at approximately 6 p.m. at the store on Gasden Highway. Police said the woman was held at gunpoint for an unspecified amount of time while she was forced to withdraw money from several ATMs.

Trussville police Capt. Jeff Bridges told the site a man laid in the back seat of the victim's vehicle as she returned her shopping cart in the parking lot. When she got in, Bridges said, the gunman pointed a gun at her and made her drive around Birmingham to be robbed.

The case is still under investigation.
