Spend any time on the internet and you’ll encounter a GIF. The animated, looping images have become a mainstay of online entertainment. Sometimes the best way to say something is through a simple animation. Most GIFs are ripped from video clips, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make your own. Services like Vine and Instagram have shown the popularity of user-created animations.

If you want to start making your own GIFs on an Android phone, there’s one app you need to try. Fixie GIF Camera is the best way to film your dog doing that one thing for posterity. It uses the perfect combination of interface and features to create an ideal GIF-making experience.

## How It Works

Open up Fixie and you’re presented with a camera. This is where the magic happens. Making GIFs requires using the app. No cheating and importing video from somewhere else.

Filming is as easy as pointing and shooting. Just open the app, point, and hold down the record button. The longer you hold it, the longer the GIF. There is a max limit, though.

Fixie takes a rapid-fire series of images while you hold down that button. Once it finishes, the app crunches the images together into a single GIF. The process never takes more than a few seconds on my Galaxy S4.

The next screen is for editing. You can add titles, frames, and funny animations. There’s a good selection of stuff there – plenty to keep users busy adding funny sunglasses to their GIFs.

You can share your annotated masterpiece after that. Fixie wisely takes you right to a menu with options to send the GIF away to any connected app. Android’s share system really shines here, as it allows you to connect to anything. You can text it to a friend, upload it to Facebook, or post it to reddit. It’s simple and brilliant.

After the fact, you can review your old GIFs, add annotations, and share like usual.

The interface deserves a serious hat tip for its simplicity and effectiveness. Its not Holo-themed, but it looks good anyway. Everything works as advertised. There’s no cruft, no excess. It just works.

### Monetization

Fixie is free to download and lets you add all the shiny stuff to your GIFs. For most usage, you won’t have to pay a cent. Two months of using this app and I haven’t found the in-app payments.

To be honest, I couldn’t find them at all. The Play Store says it has them, but I can’t find any. Maybe there’s a limit on how many smiley faces you can add before it starts charging you. The closest thing I found was a set of smiley faces that required you to share them on Facebook first.

Regardless, it says a lot that I could get two months of solid use out of Fixie without even finding the in-app purchases. If your usage is anything like mine you’ll enjoy having a free GIF camera.

### Final Thoughts

Fixie is a great app. It’s exactly what I want in a GIF app: easy to use, easy to share, and free. Can’t beat that last part.
