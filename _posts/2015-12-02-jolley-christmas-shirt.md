Harris County Sheriff Mike Jolley is selling T-shirts with [the sign that broke the internet](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/chuck-williams/article47197945.html).

<!--break-->

For $12-19 (depending on size), you can buy a politically incorrect T-shirt with "Harris County Georgia" on the front and "WARNING: Harris County is politically incorrect. We say: Merry Christmas, God Bless America and In God We Trust. We salute our troops and our flag. If this offends you... LEAVE!" on the back.

The Harris County [website](http://harris-county.com/pc/) selling the shirts said all profits from the sales will go to Jolley's favorite charities, Georgia Sheriffs' Youth Homes and Scott's Miracle Riders. Buyers can also get the shirts from [Boutique on the Square](https://www.facebook.com/Boutiqueonthesquare/) in Hamilton.

Jolley's decision to sell shirts showing his [controversial sign](http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article46241055.html) drew a condemnation from the [American Humanist Association](http://americanhumanist.org/), a group headquartered in Washington, D.C., which works to protects the rights of humanists, atheists and Americans who don't believe in a god.

"Far from being a politically incorrect joke, the Harris County sheriff's sign and t-shirts are an egregious violation of the Establishment Clause [of the Constitution]," said Monica Miller, senior counsel at the Appignani Humanist Legal Center. "Many local citizens object to the divisive message of the sign and t-shirts, which send a disturbing message of intolerance."

The Association asked Harris County stop selling the T-shirts on a government website and move the sign to private property.

The AHA gave legal reasoning to support its claim that the original sign was unconstitutional in a [letter sent on Nov. 25](http://aha-files.s3.amazonaws.com/2/3b/6/5831/20151125_Harris_County_-_Georgia_Sheriff_Sign_-_AHA_Letter.pdf).

"If it truly offends someone, they're more than welcome to leave," Jolley [told Fox & Friends](http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/11/27/georgia-sheriff-mike-jolley-proud-be-politically-incorrect) in response to the AHA. "I spent 20 years in the Army to give everyone the right to disagree with me or anyone else. If they disagree, they can voice that opinion. But if it offends them, truly offends them, then maybe they're in the wrong country."
