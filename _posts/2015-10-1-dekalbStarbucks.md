A Starbucks in the Atlanta area failed its health inspection for issues with roaches, among other problems.

The Starbucks, located on North Druid Hills Road in DeKalb County, received a score of 65 out of 100 from health inspectors according to WSB-TV. Violations included roaches crawling under the espresso machine and on the floor in front of the hand-washing sink.

An inspector said he saw an employee put his or her hand into a trash can and then use food utensils without and hand washing.

"We immediately engaged a third party vendor to conduct a thorough inspection and in-depth cleaning of our store following this health inspection,‚Äù said Jaime Riley, spokesperson.
