Country star Brad Paisley is putting on a free concert at Auburn University as the second stop on his Country Nation College Tour.

<!--break-->

Paisley will play at the Green Space (by the student center) at 8:30 p.m. tonight, according to the [OA News](http://www.oanow.com/news/auburnuniversity/article_322e918a-6ba9-11e5-b493-9f2711f2ee53.html). New country artist Eric Paslay will open for him at 7:30. The show will go on, rain or shine.

Admission is free. There will be bins set up around the area to collect canned food for the Food Bank of East Alabama. Concertgoers are encouraged to donate money or canned food.

"As the food comes in, we package it and get it ready to go out to our agencies," Martha Henk, who works with the food bank, told [WSFA](http://www.wsfa.com/story/30221773/brad-paisley-headlines-free-concert-in-auburn-on-friday). "There are no losers in this, there are only winners."

The Beat Bama Food Drive has happened annually for more than 20 years. Auburn and Alabama compete to see who can raise more for families in need.

"I know it is a competition and that is what we like to say to students because students love that competitive factor of it, but it is really about the people in our area and who we are able to feed," said Beat Bama Food Drive president Sarah Perez.

Tents, coolers, glass bottles, chairs, saving space and alcohol will be prohibited. Food trucks and concession stands will be available.
