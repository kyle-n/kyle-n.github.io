A burglary suspect committed suicide during a standoff with authorities, Columbus Police Maj. J.D. Hawk said.

Pamela Ann Skinner, 55, was pronounced dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest today at 2:15 p.m., Muscogee County Coroner Buddy Bryan said.

At about 7 p.m. Sunday, Columbus police went to the woman's mobile home in the 900 block of Joy Road to arrest Skinner on a burglary warrant, Hawk said.

"When they approached the door and knocked on it, they were told to get away and a shot was fired through the wall of the trailer," Hawk said. "The officers backed off and began negotiating with the individual."

Police said the standoff continued into the night and another shot was fired from the trailer after midnight.

"They talked to the individual as late as 7 a.m. this morning and lost contact from then on," Hawk said.

Officials went into the residence before 2:15 p.m. and found the woman with a gunshot wound to the chest. No one else was injured, Hawk said.

Joseph Braxton Jr., the woman's neighbor, said she had some mental issues and was diagnosed with cancer last Friday.

"She wasn't really a bad lady," Braxton said. "She just had drug problems."
