**Did you always want to be a musician?**

Nah, I always played sports growing up. I just loved sports, and I always loved music too. I didn't even know I could sing until I got to college at Georgia Southern University. It's kinda crazy how that happened for me. I loved music, but I didn't really know what I wanted to do until I was in college.

**Why did you start singing?**

I was a big fan of music. I was around some friends at a party. Somebody was playing a guitar and I was singing along. Somebody heard and said, 'Man, you're pretty good.' I never really sang in front of people. I just started singing more. Met up with a guy that played guitar in college and me and him played all through college together. By then I already knew what I wanted to do.

**What inspires you when you write?**

Everything. It depends on what kinda song I'm writing. Sometimes it's the title that you have, it's an idea and you have to come up with a title, sometimes it's just a melody. Sometimes you don't have anything. It all depends on the day. There's not really a set formula for writing a song. I'd say everything inspires me. You have to watch what's around you, listen to what's around you. You never know when a song idea or title might pop out.

**What inspired "Hope You Get Lonely"?**

I'm sure we've all been in the situation, but it was mainly the title of it. My producer Michael Carter and Bryan Kelly from Florida Georgia Line actually had that title, he asked if we wanted to write it, and we did. It's crazy to think today, talking to you, it's the number one song in the country.

**What are your favorite and least favorite parts opening for Luke Bryan?**

Favorite is that we're buddies and being out there with your friends is a big [advantage]. Being out there in front of all those people every night, it's huge for my career, but just to be out there sharing those memories with your buddies, it's pretty special.

The least favorite part is that it's going to have to end. There's not a least favorite part for me. I'm a new artist and anybody would kill to be in my situation. If anything, it might be that some of the shows are so big and I might feel a little nervous. Other than that, I just hate that it's going to end.

**Who are some of your influences?**
'90s country music as a whole. Tim McGraw was the big one from when I was a child. When I was in my college years, he really made me want to write songs and move to Nashville where guys like Dierks, Luke Bryan and Eric Church were. They were some of my favorites when I was coming up, just starting to play.

**What are your goals for the future?**

I want to be playing the biggest venues I can. I want to reach everybody I can. Hopefully I'll be playing NFL football stadiums, like I've had the opportunity to do this year, but I was the first act and opening for Luke Bryan. That's about as big as it gets right now. Until I can get where I'm headlining those, I've got a long way to go and I'm here to work hard.

**Have you played in Auburn before?**

I have. My first year out there I played some fraternity parties there. I haven't played there a lot, but it's always exciting. It's always been one of my favorite towns.

Hope the Auburn folks are ready for us. I'm excited to be there.
