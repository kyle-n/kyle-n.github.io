A Phenix City woman walked into Bridals by Lori looking for tailored adjustments to her wedding dress and came out with the crew from TLC show “Say Yes to the Dress.”

The wedding of Cassi Brewer, née Robbins, will be featured on Friday’s episode at 9 p.m. EST on TLC. The Brewers plan to watch the episode at J.R.'s Steakhouse. They recommend anyone who wishes to join them arrive by 8 p.m. to buy food in advance.

Cassi said she was getting her dress tailored when her mother, Cathy Robbins, disappeared. She returned with photographers from the show who began taking pictures of Cassi (Cassi said she was on board with this plan immediately).

Cathy said she told the show’s crew, who were filming another woman in the shop, about her daughter’s wedding. Even though there were just three weeks until the wedding and TLC usually plans shoots 6 months in advance, the show’s producers were interested.

Cathy said the way Stephen Brewer proposed to Cassi caught their attention. Stephen took Cassi to Cinderella’s Castle in Walt Disney World and told her to close her eyes. When she opened them, she saw an actual glass slipper with “Marry me?” engraved on it.

“We lost it,” Cassi said. “That was how the whole Cinderella wedding planning began. It was amazing.”

The Brewers were married on Sept. 5, 2015, a year and a day after the proposal, at Holy Family Catholic Church in Columbus. The reception was held in the Columbus Convention and Trade Center ballroom.

Cassi said the wedding was Cinderella themed, from the horse-and-buggy carriage imported from Dothan to the clear Cinderella shoes and 17-foot veil.

The most surprising part of being on a TV show, Cassi said, was how similar it was to the seeing the final product on TV.

“I’ve always been a huge fan of the show,” she said. “Me and my mom, we would watch the show, even years before I got engaged… They were the same people on and off camera.”

Cassi said she enjoyed the experience, even if it meant being in front of a camera all day on the day of her wedding.

“They did an amazing job,” she said. “We just couldn’t believe what we got out of this experience. It’s been amazing.”
