I recently had to get a new job. My wife got a residency in another state, and my previous job is going back to in-person.

I have two years' experience working for a startup on enterprise-scale software. My day job is on the frontend with some backend from open source work.
 
Here are some things I was asked to do while job hunting:

- Work as a contractor because the company forgot I said I'd be moving and didn’t want to file the paperwork in two states. That seemed reasonable, so I agreed. At the time, I did not know the school or state of my wife’s residency.[^1] The company waffled, then pulled the offer with no explanation. They did at least pay me for time spent on the technical screen. 
- Fill out a recruiter’s profile of me for him (Word doc and internal assessment and all).
- Pass a cognitive test asking me to do basic arithmetic and convert fractions as fast as I could.
- Take a personality test where I had to select adjectives I felt applied to me.
- Enter my years of experience with "Problem Solving." I am 28 years old, so I put 28.
- Listen to a recruiter tell me I could move to South Florida for a job after a year because "who knows if you and your girlfriend will still be together." I had referred to her as my wife on the same call.

The cognitive test actually made me laugh. Imagine a workplace where someone yells, "Nazario! Get over here, we need someone add some fractions! No calculators!!!"

Anyway, hiring is broken, we all know it. I accepted a position with a [company](https://www.bitovi.com) that had a sane, speedy hiring process.

[^1]: Veterinarians can do a residency if they want to specialize, like to be a neurologist or cardiologist. You get most residencies through “the match.” Prospective residents rank programs they’re most interested in, and the programs rank applicants. On a given date in the spring, you find out if or where you matched.<br><br>This is why for several weeks, I knew we would be in Tennessee, Florida, Indiana or California, but not the specific state.
