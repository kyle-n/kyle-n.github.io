Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson drew my attention this morning when he tweeted his thanks to a band for writing a song about... Sen. Johnny Isakson.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow, never had a song written about me. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PapaRazziAndThePhotogs?src=hash">#PapaRazziAndThePhotogs</a>. I&#39;m undeserving but flattered nonetheless. <a href="https://t.co/SdPaMKVgOI">https://t.co/SdPaMKVgOI</a></p>&mdash; Johnny Isakson (@SenatorIsakson) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorIsakson/status/672423470349832192">December 3, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've linked another copy of the song below, and it is... something.

The singer is an odd duck. From [Vice](http://noisey.vice.com/blog/This-Genius-Lunatic-Has-Recorded-16000-Songs-About-Everything-from-Poop-to-Ellen-Degeneres):

> Matt Farley is a guy in his mid-30s living in Northeastern Massachusetts. He runs an entertainment company called Motern Media that manages about 70 bands that together have recorded just over 16,000 songs. The thing is, he also plays in all of the bands and sings in all of the bands and is the only person in all of them. Motern Media is Matt Farley.

This guy churns out an average of 20 songs per day. It's all weird stuff designed to pick up people searching weird terms for very specific songs. He makes a little bit of money every time you search for a song about [knowing how to tie a tie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SLX_qO1uvQ) or [how great Robert Downey, Jr. is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBfX9ucGXNU). It works, too- [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2014/jan/29/spotify-how-a-busy-songwriter-youve-never-heard-of-makes-it-work-for-him) said Farley makes $23,000 a year from his entire catalogue.

This song about Johnny Isakson comes from [an album of songs about U.S. Senators](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/u.s.-senators/id954900502). Why does that exist?

Why not?
