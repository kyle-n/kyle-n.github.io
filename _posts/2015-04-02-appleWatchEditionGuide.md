With the Apple Watch's April 24 release date three weeks away, it's worth taking a step back to plan exactly which Apple Watch is best for you. That's right- Apple is making multiple versions, with multiple different styles, at multiple different prices.

We've put together a guide for navigating Apple's mess of watch sizes, bands and materials. If you're looking to buy the latest and greatest wearable from our favorite company in Cupertino, here's what you need to know. 

## How do I buy an Apple Watch?

You can't, until its April 24 release date. Pre-orders online and through the App Store app begin April 10. 

You can just walk into an Apple Store to try on a watch, though you'll have to wait in line with everyone else who wants to try it. 

### Where can I buy the Apple Watch?

The Apple Watch is launching in nine countries: US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, China, Hong Kong and Japan. It'll roll out to other countries in the future. 

According to 9to5Mac, the Apple Watch will also feature in other locations.

> "In addition to the Apple Store, the Apple Watch will be available to preview and try on starting April 10th at Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Selfridges in London, and Isetan in Tokyo. Starting April 24th, the Apple Watch will also be sold at Colette in Paris, Dover Street Market in London and Tokyo, Maxfield in Los Angeles, and The Corner in Berlin."

### How much does each version cost? 

This is the interesting part. The Apple Watch comes in three versions. There's the Apple Watch Sport ($349), Apple Watch ($549), and oddly named Apple Watch Edition ($10,000). 

The Sport is the cheapest version. It comes in silver and space gray anodized aluminum. 

The 38-mm version is slightly smaller than the 42-mm one, which starts at $399. 

The Apple Watch is the next version up and ships in stainless steel. It also has a sapphire-crystal screen. 

The stainless steel one comes in twenty different models, which vary in price from $549 to $1099 depending on the band and size. 

The Apple Watch Edition is the most expensive version. It is made of gold and starts at $10,000. You cannot try or even buy one by walking in. 

The Watch Edition comes in eight different models and can vary in price up to $17,000. It's only meant for the richest of Apple fans, so spend wisely. 

It's worth noting that all of these watches are functionally identical. When you shell out for a more expensive version, you're buying better materials, a larger screen and a nicer band. Speaking of which...

### What kind of bands does it use?

The band types vary by price and watch version. The Sport uses only a rubber Sport Band that comes in white, blue, green, red and black. 

Pricing is easy - $349 for the 38-mm version, $399 for the 42-mm version. 

The prices of the stainless steel Apple Watch and gold Apple Watch Edition are a little more complex. Here are some charts, courtesy of Macrumors. 

### What accessories do I get with it?

According to Apple's website, you get a charging cable that attaches to the watch's back magnetically with every Apple Watch. Additional cables are $29 and $39 for 1- and 2-foot cables, respectively. 

### Which Apple Watch is worth buying? 

The "best" version of the Apple Watch depends on your price and how you feel about different materials. Can you see yourself wearing an aluminum watch with a rubber band? Or is a nice stainless steel band a necessity? 

The Watch Sport is the best choice for people who plan to download Runtastic and get working out immediately. For businesspeople and anyone looking for a classy watch, the stainless steel Apple Watch is best. For those who like to flaunt their wealth, get an Apple Watch Edition. 

Consider also skipping the initial Apple Watch entirely. There's still a lot we don't know. How often will these watches be updated? When will we see the Apple Watch 2? What hidden bugs are there? 

Remember how incomplete the original iPhone. While it's a powerful and flexible phone today, it certainly didn't use to be. It may be worth waiting to see if the Apple Watch goes through the same process.
