Meg McGuffin, a former Miss Phenix City and Auburn student, had some harsh words for Donald Trump at last night's Miss America contest. When asked why Trump has an impressive lead over the rest of the Republican Party, McGuffin didn't hesitate.

"I think Donald Trump is an entertainer," McGuffin said. "I think he says what's on a lot of people's minds but I think that the Republican Party should be absolutely terrified of all the attention he's taking from credible candidates like Jeb Bush and Chris Christie who can absolutely do the job of president of the United States. And, if I were a Republican, I would absolutely be terrified of that. Thank you so much."

McGuffin was supported by a group from the Miss Phenix City program who made the trip to New Jersey. McGuffin, a former winner from Ozark, Ala., said she aims to pursue a Ph.D. in education leadership funded by her winnings from pageants, which total more than $80,000 after she finished in fourth place at last night's Miss America.

"I will hopefully attain my Ph.D. and be student-debt free," McGuffin said.
