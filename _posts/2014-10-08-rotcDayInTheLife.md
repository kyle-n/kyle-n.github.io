The artificial lighting from a single set of floodlights threw long shadows around the cadets as they walked onto the field. They lined up in four rows in the pre-dawn darkness at 6 a.m. Oct. 1.

The Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets stretched their legs. Some did practice pushups. All wore black shorts, tennis shoes, a neon yellow weight belt and a gray Army shirt.

This is the beginning of a day in the life of an ROTC cadet.

The cadets gathered at the old track to take their physical fitness test. This one was a diagnostic test, according to Walter Austin, senior military science instructor. The test would tell the cadets how they were progressing physically.

Forty-two sophomores and four seniors lined up as an officer read them the rules of the test. They had two minutes to do the Army minimum number of pushups (42 for men and 19 for women).

Once they heard the rules, the cadets broke into groups of six. One person assumed the pushup position while the group faced away.

Austin said he didn't know why Army regulations require the cadets to face away while one person from each group does pushups.

"There's plenty of things we do in the Army where someone says, 'Why do we do that?' and the answer is 'Because we've always done it that way,'" Austin said.

Austin, former member of the Georgia National Guard, served tours in Iraq and Kosovo.

The cadets did their pushups quickly. In the last 30 seconds, many bore pained expressions as they struggled to finish.

Rachael Blaz, Army ROTC cadet and junior in nursing, said despite the stringent physical requirements, she likes "being able to give back where (she) can and serve where (she) can" in the Army ROTC.

"I think everyone has the capability of serving," Blaz said. "This is my way of serving."

Blaz said she is on track to graduate and receive a commission as a second lieutenant in 2016. She will either serve as an active-duty officer or in the reserves as a nurse.

The cadets moved on to their second test -- sit-ups. Each person had two minutes to complete at least 53 sit-ups with a partner.

By the time each cadet finished doing sit-ups, the sun had risen.

The cadets took a short break before starting their two-mile run.

Evan Cadotte, Army ROTC cadet and junior in hotel and restaurant management, said he didn't know why he wanted to join the Army.

"I don't really have a good answer for it," Cadotte said. "I just wanted to be in the Army."

Cadotte said he didn't want a simple desk job.

"I want to be doing something while I'm young and still can," Cadotte said.
