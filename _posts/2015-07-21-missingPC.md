A 16-year-old Phenix City boy with severe autism was found Tuesday about two hours after he was reported missing.

Timothy Robinson was located in a deep ravine by an Alabama Law Enforcement Agency's helicopter after he was seen on a neighbor's security camera. Authorities said he appeared exhausted while lying on the ground between two logs.

The helicopter crew directed law enforcement personnel to the teen who was taken to a waiting ambulance. Police sent out a notice at 2:56 p.m. that an aviation unit located Robinson.

With a heat index of triple digits, Secretary of Law Enforcement Spencer Collier said the search could have ended differently. "With a triple digit heat index, today's rescue of the missing 16-year-old could have had a tragic ending without ALEA's Aviation Unit. This unit provides an essential state service as we assist in rescue efforts throughout the state," he said.

A missing child alert was issued of the teen after he was discovered missing from his residence on Williamsburg Drive in Phenix City, according to a release.

Authorities said the 5-foot-4 inch Robinson is autistic and unable to verbally communicate. He was last seen wearing a white t-shirt and pull-up.

Anyone with information on his whereabouts was asked to contact the Phenix City Police Department at 334- 298-0611.
