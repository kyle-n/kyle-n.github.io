Jailbreaking is a simple process with a lot of hidden parts. After you’ve learned why jailbreaking is important and jailbroken iOS 8.1.2 with TaiG, you have to live in jailbreak land.

There are a couple parts nobody tells you, though. Be sure to watch out for this stuff after your jailbreak. These are some of the lessons I’ve learned from running a jailbreak on every version of iOS from 3.1.3. 

## Less is More

When you first install Cydia, there’s a temptation to go crazy and download as many things as you can. Jailbreaking is awesome, and it can be hard to hold back at times. 

You can change so much in iOS, but consider whether you should. Stock iOS is a great operating system as it is. It’s not perfect, but it doesn’t need a lot of changes. 

Making major system-level changes can destabilize iOS as well. Jailbreaking these days isn’t nearly as unstable as it used to be, but there are still risks. Stacking multiple system-level changes on top of each other has caused me trouble many times.

You might be able to change tons and tons of iOS, but that doesn’t mean you should. 

### Don’t Touch the System Files

One of my personal favorite parts of jailbreaking is being able to dig into the iOS file system. It’s fascinating to see what makes an iPhone tick. 

However, I (and you should as well) operate under a strict policy of “look but don’t touch.” Unless you’ve a developer, you should not touch any of the system files. 

### Prepare for the worst

Stuff doesn’t often go wrong, but your odds of crashing your iPhone are definitely higher with multiple tweaks going simultaneously. Prepare for that.

You can prepare by saving backups to iCloud and your computer through iTunes. That’ll back up content and data. 

You should also install OpenSSH from Cydia. Some users have run into trouble where their phone gets caught in a bootloop. OpenSSH is the only way they could save it.

This actually happened to me once on my old iPod Touch. A bad Dreamboard theme made it reboot. Unfortunately, when it tried to load that theme again on startup, it would immediate crash and reboot. I ended up saving the phone by sending commands through OpenSSH over USB. There was a 5-10 second window when it booted where I could SSH in. That was just enough time to reboot it in no substrate mode.

Speaking of which, if this happens to you, try booting while holding volume up. That’ll load iOS without any tweaks running. 

Simple stuff like checking for iOS 8 compatibility will go a long way toward keeping your system stable. Just download carefully. 

### Final Thoughts

Jailbreaking can be confusing at times. I sure was unhappy that I’d jailbroken when my iPod Touch was bootlooping and I wasn’t sure I could save it. That said, I still appreciate all the cool stuff I’ve used stemming from jailbreaking. In the end, it’s been worth it.
