The Better Business Bureau sent out a warning about a scam that may show up in postal service mailboxes.

<!--break-->

The letter from the "Secret Society" asks for $135 for "10 miracles that will transform your life," including:

* Slim down to a body others will envy
* Become a genius
* Unlock your hidden creativity
* Live as a VIP
* Make $5,000 a month
* The service offers to send you a Secret Manuscript explaining how to obtain these rewards.

The Bureau called the whole system a pyramid scheme that would require victims to recruit more people into the scam.

The Bureau advised consumers to avoid letters that offer pie-in-the-sky statements, say they'll give benefits if you recruit others, ask that you keep information confidential, or require you to send a check or credit card.

As always with scams: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
