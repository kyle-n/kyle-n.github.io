Katherine McCarron, a Phenix City native and wife of former Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron, was not happy about an invasion of the Cincinnati Bengals' privacy.

<!--break-->

The NFL Network conducted an interview with Adam "Pacman" Jones with several of his teammates nude in the background. They were showering and changing into street clothes.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No missing the point. Players should have their privacy. I&#39;m sure female reports would rather not be in there <a href="https://t.co/1FjAXHQxPH">https://t.co/1FjAXHQxPH</a></p>&mdash; Katherine McCarron (@_KatherineWebb) <a href="https://twitter.com/_KatherineWebb/status/656216906165329924">October 19, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

An NFL Network told ESPN the interview was "a regrettable mistake."

Bengals offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth also took to Twitter to vent his frustrations over the choice of interview location.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">why do I have to explain to my kids why their dad is naked on tv? &#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/nflcommish">@nflcommish</a> ?? &#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/nflnetwork">@nflnetwork</a> ??&#10;Time for a media policy change!!</p>&mdash; Andrew Whitworth (@BigWhit77_fndn) <a href="https://twitter.com/BigWhit77_fndn/status/656107615588626433">October 19, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
