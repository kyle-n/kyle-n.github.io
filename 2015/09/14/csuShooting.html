    <p><strong>Update</strong>: Phenix City Police have charged 18-year-old Demetrius Devonta Dorsey with the murder of Mariah Farrow.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Dorsey was taken into custody without incident around 11:15 a.m. today. Members of Phenix City Police Departments Criminal Investigation Division and the U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Regional Task Force executed a search and arrest warrant at 2601 14th Court in that resulted in Dorsey’s arrest.</p>

<p>Mike Haskey mhaskey@ledger-enquirer.comNeighbors told the Ledger-Enquirer they heard loud arguing near the intersection of 16th Street and 10th Court around 11 to 11:30 p.m. It was near midnight when they heard two gunshots before the sounds of some vehicles “peeling out,” they said. 09/14/15 Demetrius Devonta Dorsey Mike Haskey mhaskey@ledger-enquirer.comNeighbors told the Ledger-Enquirer they heard loud arguing near the intersection of 16th Street and 10th Court around 11 to 11:30 p.m. It was near midnight when they heard two gunshots before the sounds of some vehicles “peeling out,” they said. </p>

<p>He is currently incarcerated in Russell County Jail, authorities said.</p>

<p>Phenix City Police would like anyone who may have firsthand information pertinent to the investigation to contact Phenix City Police Criminal Investigations.</p>

<p><strong>Original Story</strong>: A 19-year-old Columbus woman suffering from a gunshot wound died this morning at Midtown Medical Center, according to a post by Phenix City Police on their Facebook page.</p>

<p>Phenix City police said they received reports of shots fired in the 1000 block of 16th Street around 11:50 p.m. Sunday but did not find anyone when they arrived. They said they were notified by Columbus police “a short time later” that a woman had been driven to Midtown Medical Center while suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>Hospital personnel were unable to revive 19-year-old Mariah Farrow, a 2015 graduate of Carver High School and current Columbus State University student. She was pronounced at 12:18 a.m., Russell County Coroner Arthur Sumbry Jr. said.</p>

<p>Her body will be transported to the Department of Forensic Sciences in Montgomery for an autopsy, according to the coroner.</p>

<p>Phenix City police said they are investigating the case and are “currently interviewing a number of witnesses.”</p>

<p>At 2:45 p.m. Monday, CSU sent out an email to their students, faculty and staff informing them about Farrow’s death, according to CSU Communications Specialist Christa Robbins.</p>

<p>The unofficial statement reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CSU students, faculty and staff,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is with great sadness that we report the death of a Columbus State University freshman, Mariah Farrow, 19, an undeclared first-term, first-year student from Columbus. She was apparently involved in an off-campus shooting last evening.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Please keep the family in your thoughts and prayers.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone with additional information on the case should contact the Phenix City Police Department Criminal Investigations Division. The police dispatch number is 334-298-0611.</p>
