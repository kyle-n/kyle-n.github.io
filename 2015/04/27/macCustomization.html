    <p>I love my Mac precisely because it doesn’t need customization. OS X is functional and beautiful out of the box and doesn’t require fixing on the most part. It’s a mature, stable Unix-based system with Apple-level money behind its gorgeous design. What’s not to like?</p>

<!--break-->

<p>However, OS X isn’t perfect. It’ll never be all things to everyone. There may be that one thing you want to change and wish you could customize. That’s why we’ve composed a comprehensive guide to customizing everything important in OS X. </p>

<h2 id="the-complete-guide-to-customizing-your-mac">The Complete Guide to Customizing Your Mac</h2>

<p>OS X is a beautiful-looking system, but it could always use a little spitshine. Here’s how to change some of the aesthetic bits. </p>

<h3 id="how-to-change-the-looks">How to Change the Looks</h3>

<p>For interface customization, you’ll want <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">GeekTool</a>. It’s a neat program for customizing your Mac’s interface and adding all kinds of useful information to the desktop. </p>

<p>With GeekTool, you can do things like: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Display system info such as memory, CPU usage, and battery</li>
  <li>Show tasks from productivity apps</li>
  <li>Put calendars on your desktop</li>
  <li>Display the time and date</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need inspiration, check out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GeekTool/">/r/GeekTool</a>, a subreddit of fellow Mac customization nerds. </p>

<p>There are a ton of useful options there, and I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who’s ever wanted a transparent dock or for their desktop to display the weather like Windows’ widgets do. </p>

<p>Yosemite brought a new aesthetic problem to non-Retina Macs- a new font clearly designed for HD screens. The older Lucinda Grande font looks better to a lot of people on standard-definition screens. </p>

<p>Mac geeks put together a small script to change the system font back to Lucinda Grande. Installation instructions are included on the <a href="https://github.com/schreiberstein/lucidagrandeyosemite">download website</a>. </p>

<h3 id="how-to-change-the-functionality">How to Change the Functionality</h3>

<p>For changing features, check out our <a href="http://www.technorms.com/43425/fix-os-x-yosemite-biggest-annoyances">guide for fixing some of the biggest annoyances on OS X</a>. </p>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://tweaksapp.com/app/mountain-tweaks/">Mountain Tweaks</a> to customize some of the system-level behavior in OS X. There are options to toggle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user Library folder</li>
  <li>System window animation</li>
  <li>Permanent scrollbars</li>
  <li>Hidden files</li>
  <li>Highlight Stack items on mouseover</li>
  <li>Colors in Finder sidebar</li>
  <li>Gatekeeper</li>
  <li>Smooth scrolling</li>
  <li>Rubber-banding when scrolling</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, if there’s something about OS X’s behavior, check out Mountain Tweaks. </p>

<p>For me, the biggest thing that annoyed me coming to OS X was the lack of a delete key and a cut command. The best advice is to get used to Cmd-C and Cmd-Opt-V. </p>

<p>If you can’t get used to that, check out <a href="http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/">Xtrafinder</a>. It’s a useful little app that adds Cmd-X support to OS X and auto-sorts folders at the top of the page. </p>

<h3 id="how-to-add-keyboard-commands-to-everything">How to Add Keyboard Commands to Everything</h3>

<p>MacBook trackpads are excellent, but they’re still more awkward than using keyboard shortcuts for everything. I prefer to memorize as much as I can and be more efficient from the keyboard. </p>

<p>To help with that, check out <a href="http://qsapp.com">Quicksilver</a>. I’ve <a href="http://www.technorms.com/37671/quicksilver-for-mac-improves-productivity">written about it before</a> in glowing terms. When you realize how powerful it is, Quicksilver becomes indispensable. </p>

<p>I use Quicksilver every time I open my computer to launch apps, move and rename files, send email and basically run my computer from the keyboard. It’s usually faster that way. </p>

<p>Power users and keyboard shortcut nerds looking for a faster way to work on OS X should absolutely try out Quicksilver. It’s amazing. </p>

<p>Alternatively, some people like <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>. It’s more based on custom scripts than Quicksilver, but it enjoys more developer support and popularity. Both apps are great choices. </p>

<h3 id="how-to-fix-the-mouse-with-bettertouchtool">How to Fix the Mouse With BetterTouchTool</h3>

<p>If you are into using the touchpad or a regular mouse, check out <a href="http://www.boastr.net">BetterTouchTool</a>. It adds a crazy amount of customization to mouse actions for the entire system or specific apps. </p>

<p>There are options for three-finger taps and different gestures. These can be attached to scripts, apps or actions. </p>

<p>The real draw is in launching scripts from mouse gestures. Linking AppleScript opens the door. Want to launch Chrome with a four-finger double-tap? Done. The sky’s the limit here. </p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
