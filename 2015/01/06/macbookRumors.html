    <p>The internet reeled in shock today as Mark Gurman over at 9to5Mac showed up with some shocking news about the long-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air. Apple was taking everything we thought we knew about computers and changing it. Again. It’s slimming down the frame to be even lighter than the current Airs, taking away the clickable part of the trackpad and (worst of all) removing all but one USB 3.1-C port. There won’t even be a power cable.</p>

<p>If you’re freaking out about the news, don’t. At times like this, it’s worth taking a step back and remembering the past. All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again. Apple is taking away our precious USB ports because it knows what people want more than we do. </p>

<h2 id="whats-coming">What’s Coming</h2>

<p>If you haven’t seen it yet, check out Gurman’s <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/">report</a>. He is the lucky recipient of an impressively detailed “leak” that just so happens to coincide with CES, a show where other tech companies are trying to steal the spotlight. There is a good chance this is a controlled leak from Apple. Even if it’s not, Gurman has a stellar record of guessing what comes out of Cupertino.</p>

<p>The next MacBook Air will be 12 inches and sport a Retina display. Intel’s new fanless Broadwell chips will drive the system, and what a system to drive.</p>

<p>Apple is taking the already absurdly small MacBook Air and shrinking it further. Gurman posted some interesting renders of the usual MacBook keyboard just slightly tweaked to fit the keys into a tiny frame. </p>

<p>The biggest change is the lack of ports. This leak claims there will be a single USB 3.1 port and a headphone jack. It’s a hell of a port, too. It will supposedly carry power, transmit data and be able to drive an external display. </p>

<p>Of course, you can’t do all of those things simultaneously, so there are also rumors of an external hub to connect multiple goodies at once. </p>

<h3 id="so-crazy-it-just-might-work">So Crazy, It Just Might Work</h3>

<p>All this sounds insane on the surface. A computer with one port? Seriously? They moved the power key where Escape used to be!</p>

<p>The idea of so few ports is unimaginable. I can personally attest to this. Right now I have my mouse, power cable, headphones and external hard drive plugged into my 2013 MacBook Air. How the hell are we supposed to get by without our USB and MagSafe ports? </p>

<p>The answer is the same one we realized (and forgot) in 2008 when the original Air released with minimal storage and no ethernet port or optical drive. People couldn’t understand how it would work without things we considered so essential in a laptop. </p>

<p>As we figured out over time, we didn’t need those things. Physical CDs have become a niche need, something I use every couple months to update my mother’s computer with the new version of Ubuntu. Wireless internet is prevalent enough to make ethernet niche. Storage these days is less what’s on your hard drive and more how much of the cloud you have reserved. </p>

<p>The original MacBook Air was incomprehensible by the industry standards of 2008. We didn’t understand because our view of computing hadn’t evolved to accommodate such a device. </p>

<p>The same process is happening today with the single-port Air. We can’t understand it or why somebody would want to do without stuff we consider essential, and once again we are wrong. </p>

<p>The 12-inch MacBook Air will probably be successful for exactly the reasons some point to for it to fail. People will love its light weight. They’ll love its simplicity and single port. They’ll love its display. </p>

<p>Storage? iCloud Drive. Ports? A hub to keep on your desk. Keyboard? You’ll get used to it. </p>

<p>At this point, you’re probably thinking about how your needs are different, and how you could never work on something like that — and you’re probably right. </p>

<p>If you’re reading tech news at all, you are not the intended audience for this computer. The simplified MacBook Air is aimed at Mom and Dad, not tech-savvy users.</p>

<p>The 12-inch Air will likely not fit your needs well, and that’s OK. There are a whole lot of other people who will love it. </p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Basically, everybody needs to take a step back and remember three things. One, new technology rarely fits into existing paradigms. It may bring us benefits we can’t even imagine. </p>

<p>Two, you are not the consumer of a one-port computer. You and I may have to stick to MacBook Pros or the larger Airs, but it’s OK if Apple makes something we don’t like. They’re not obligated to do anything for us. </p>

<p>Lastly, remember that we don’t know anything official about this computer. Until Tim Cook tells us it’s real, it may as well be Bigfoot. Let’s wait and see before making a judgment. </p>
