    <p>I enjoy using OS X on Macs because it requires the least amount of tweaking to become a strong, functional way to interact with your computer. Where Windows is missing key features and Linux hides them under endless customization, OS X usually has the stuff I want already enabled. Usually.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>When it doesn’t, it means making some changes. There are a few real annoyances in OS X, and you can fix those easily with third-party programs and changing some settings. Here’s how to do it. </p>

<h2 id="search-the-folder-not-your-mac">Search the folder, not your Mac</h2>

<p>Cmd-F’ing within a folder on Macs does not work as it should. Instead of searching the folder, which is why anyone would click search within that window, it searches the entire OS X operating system. </p>

<p>That’s useless. If I wanted a system-wide search, I’d use Spotlight. </p>

<p>To make Finder search the folder first, by default, open Finder and hit Cmd-, to open the preferences menu. Go to Advanced and click the box underneath “When performing a search:”.</p>

<p>Change this to “Search the Current Folder.” That will set the default behavior to something more sane. </p>

<h3 id="proper-cut-and-paste">Proper Cut-and-Paste</h3>

<p>One of the hardest things to get used to as a Windows emigré was the lack of Cmd-X support. Instead, Apple wants you to do Cmd-C, Cmd-Opt-V to cut and paste items. </p>

<p>Another change from Windows is that folders are organized alongside other files instead of being automatically moved and sorted within the header of Finder.</p>

<p>This is confusing, honestly. Those differences help in Windows, they aren’t bad. </p>

<p>To get something a little more sane, check out <a href="http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/">Xtrafinder</a>. It fixes the folder organization, adds cut-and-paste support along with a bunch of other useful features like middle-click and colorful sidebar icons. </p>

<p>Best of all? It’s free to download. </p>

<h3 id="no-more-bing">No more Bing</h3>

<p>Apple insists on adding features to Spotlight that aren’t especially useful. For what it’s worth, you shouldn’t even be using Spotlight, as Quicksilver is much better.</p>

<p>To toggle what Spotlight searches, click the Apple logo in the top left and choose “System Preferences.” From there open the Spotlight menu.</p>

<p>This will present a list of items for Spotlight to search. Uncheck whatever you don’t want. </p>

<h3 id="reduce-all-the-transparency">Reduce all the transparency</h3>

<p>Yosemite is all about putting transparent window elements on your desktop like it’s 2007 and Windows Vista is the latest and greatest thing. </p>

<p>To get rid of all the transparency, open the System Preferences again and choose “Accessibility.” Under “Display” on the left, check “Reduce transparency.” </p>

<p>That will turn those partially transparent boxes into flat silver squares and make the desktop a little less distracting. </p>

<h3 id="stop-all-the-notifications">Stop all the notifications</h3>

<p>I like iMessage, but it can be a little annoying to have messages pop up on my screen and stay there until they’re cleared. Same goes for other notification-happy programs. </p>

<p>To fix this, open the Notification Center by clicking the triple-bar icon in the top right. Select the “Notifications” panel and then choose the gears icon at the bottom. </p>

<p>You can go through and set app-specific settings, as well as general Do Not Disturb settings for the system. </p>

<h3 id="update-your-apps">Update your apps</h3>

<p>Is one of your apps misbehaving? Weird bug that prevents it from launching? Chances are someone else has had the same issue already. </p>

<p>Check the App Store for updates on all your programs. Keeping them up-to-date often solves common problems with apps, first- and third-party. </p>

<h3 id="install-third-party-apps-without-os-x-hassling-you">Install third-party apps without OS X hassling you</h3>

<p>Apple wants you to download everything from the Mac App Store, but that doesn’t fly all the time. There are a lot of famous programs that sell outside the store. Too bad downloading one means changing the settings. </p>

<p>To let more in, open System Preferences and go to “Security &amp; Privacy.” Click the lock in the bottom left and enter your password to unlock the settings.</p>

<p>To allow non-Mac App Store apps, select the second or third option there. I allow apps from anywhere, but most users should be fine sticking to identified developers. </p>

<p>Once you’re done, click the lock again.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>OS X is a solid operating system, but its quirks are annoying at times. Cmd-Opt-V? Really?</p>
