  on the web or mobile platforms. During the day I am a software engineer for <a href="https://www.servicecore.com/" target="_blank">ServiceCore</a>, developing an enterprise-scale product for running waste management businesses. At night, I make <a
  href="https://composeforsubstack.app" target="_blank">Compose for Substack</a>, the first and only native Substack app.
