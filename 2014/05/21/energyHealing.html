    <p>Ever had one of those “What the hell am I doing here?” moments?</p>

<!--break-->

<p>There I was, holding hands with a circle of 29 strangers, saying “ohm” for as long as I could. We did it three times to send as much energy into the center of the circle as possible.</p>

<p>Looking around at the serious faces scrunched up in prayer, I kept wondering why I had decided to come to a run-down church on the south side of Houston.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help it. I had to see energy healing.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-does-this-work">So how does this work?</h3>

<p>You try odd things when you’re bored and in a new city. An hour of digging through Houston events revealed a monthly meetup of people dedicated to “energy healing.”</p>

<p>The name alone caught my eye. Energy healing sounds like something from Star Wars. I had to see it.</p>

<p>(For the sake of politeness, I’ve omitted the last names of everyone involved.)</p>

<p>No one could answer my biggest question, which is what energy healing actually is.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mary, a nurse who praises its transformative powers. “I’ve never had to explain it to anybody.”</p>

<p>Mary was nice enough to show me a diagram of my chakras on her iPhone. Apparently mine were clogged, and energy healing was the only way to clear them. I still don’t understand what a chakra is, except that Aang had to clear his chakras to master his avatar powers in Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to understand how energy healing worked, despite my persistent questions.</p>

<p>“I’m not clear either, I don’t know how to describe it,” the guy to my left said.</p>

<p>A two-page introductory packet from Juan, the healer running the event, cited “bad energy,” not chakras, as the cause of many problems.</p>

<p>Apparently our auras suffer around electromagnetic radiation, pollution, illness and negativity. Considering that electromagnetic radiation includes radio waves, microwaves and visible light, my aura must have been in awful shape.</p>

<h3 id="the-healing-process">The healing process</h3>

<p>Energy healing is bizarre. People sat on wooden stools in the center of the room while healers stood next to them and did their thing.</p>

<p>One woman looked like she was doing interpretive dance. Another guy was making a motion like he was dumping salt from a giant salt shaker above his healee’s head. Most people just held their hands a foot away from their subject and concentrated.</p>

<p>The whole thing looked surreal. You normally don’t see this level of hoverhand outside of a middle school dance.</p>

<p>I had to try it.</p>

<h3 id="feel-the-power">Feel the power</h3>

<p>I grabbed a stool when they switched out the healees. My healer was a thirtysomething guy named Brian. He asked me if I felt any pain. Couldn’t say I did, other than the lingering agony of Community‘s cancellation.</p>

<p>The next 15 minutes were uncomfortable. I sat there and tried not to slouch while Brian waved his hands around my shoulders.</p>

<p>He moved around me, holding his hands a foot away from me. His inhalations were the kind of deep, slow breathing you hear from someone fast asleep or seconds away from stabbing you. It was weird.</p>

<p>At the end, he touched my shoulder and asked if I felt any pain in my spine. Nothing other than a lifetime of slouching.</p>

<p>I took inventory of myself after experiencing energy healing. Sure enough, I felt exactly the same, just stiffer from sitting on a backless hard wooden stool. Energy healing did nothing for me.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-real">Is it real?</h3>

<p>Energy healing has dubious effectiveness from a scientific perspective.</p>

<p>“There is currently no conclusive evidence that energy healing is more effective than placebo,” Dr. Val Jones <a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/energy-healing-in-maryland/">wrote</a> for Science-Based Medicine. “Furthermore, there’s no known mechanism whereby an unmeasurable energy could be manipulated to improve one’s health.”</p>

<p>Jones credits success in alternative medicines like energy healing to emotional support and placebo.</p>

<p>Placebo, for those of you who slept through science class, is when you give a patient fake medicine and tell them it’s the real thing. Some people get better simply from believing the medicine will work. That’s energy healing in a nutshell. Its legitimate, scientific value is imaginary at best.</p>

<p>Sure, energy healing could make you feel better, but you’re better off skipping the whole thing and taking some sugar pills. It’s the same thing in the end.</p>
