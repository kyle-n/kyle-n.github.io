  <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2021</span>
  
  <p>I recently had to get a new job. My wife got a residency in another state, and my previous job is going back to in-person.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>I have two years’ experience working for a startup on enterprise-scale software. My day job is on the frontend with some backend from open source work.</p>

<p>Here are some things I was asked to do while job hunting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work as a contractor because the company forgot I said I’d be moving and didn’t want to file the paperwork in two states. That seemed reasonable, so I agreed. At the time, I did not know the school or state of my wife’s residency.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The company waffled, then pulled the offer with no explanation. They did at least pay me for time spent on the technical screen.</li>
  <li>Fill out a recruiter’s profile of me for him (Word doc and internal assessment and all).</li>
  <li>Pass a cognitive test asking me to do basic arithmetic and convert fractions as fast as I could.</li>
  <li>Take a personality test where I had to select adjectives I felt applied to me.</li>
  <li>Enter my years of experience with “Problem Solving.” I am 28 years old, so I put 28.</li>
  <li>Listen to a recruiter tell me I could move to South Florida for a job after a year because “who knows if you and your girlfriend will still be together.” I had referred to her as my wife on the same call.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cognitive test actually made me laugh. Imagine a workplace where someone yells, “Nazario! Get over here, we need someone add some fractions! No calculators!!!”</p>

<p>Anyway, hiring is broken, we all know it. I accepted a position with a <a href="https://www.bitovi.com">company</a> that had a sane, speedy hiring process.</p>

      <p>Veterinarians can do a residency if they want to specialize, like to be a neurologist or cardiologist. You get most residencies through “the match.” Prospective residents rank programs they’re most interested in, and the programs rank applicants. On a given date in the spring, you find out if or where you matched.<br /><br />This is why for several weeks, I knew we would be in Tennessee, Florida, Indiana or California, but not the specific state. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
