### Background

I've always loved technology. As a teenager, I was fascinated by the process of jailbreaking my iPod Touch and replacing the Springboard background with a live HTML file that cycled background images.

After spending a few years [working in news](./about-me.html), I decided to pursue my real passion. I spent the next year doing online classes to brush up on things I'd learned in my computer science minor. 

### My promise

I am a self-taught web developer who loves solving problems. I spent two hours learning web technologies every day of the last year because I love it.

I will work hard and learn from anyone I can to become a better full-stack web developer. I hope to [hear from you](#ftr)!

I built these projects to showcase my development abilities. All are Angular 6+ applications served by Node servers. The first two implement the full MEAN stack.
