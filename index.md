I'm Kyle Nazario. I'm a web developer with a passion for learning and an aptitude for picking up new tools quickly. I hope I can help you and your company. 

My education includes a bachelor's degree with a minor in computer science. I have experience with MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Angular, Node.js, Passport.js and more. Front end is where I have done the most work, though I have also set up my own [server](https://github.com/kyle-n/dragon-collector/blob/master/db-code/server.js), [API](https://github.com/kyle-n/dragon-collector/tree/master/db-code/routers) and [worked with external APIs](https://github.com/kyle-n/backlogged/blob/master/backlogged-code/giantbomb.js) on the backend. 

I used to [work in journalism](./about-me.html) as a producer, editor and writer. This gave me an appreciation for work with detail and precision (ask me about the plane "crash"!). However, when I realized I enjoyed writing Python scripts for my job more than the job itself, I knew it was time for a change. 

Since then I have spent two hours per day learning web development tools and building sites, which you can see from my portfolio below. I hope to hear from you!
