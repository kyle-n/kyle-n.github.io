        <title>Get excited for the national championship with this hype video</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Alabama Crimson Tide are taking on the Clemson Tigers in the national championship game on Jan. 11. Before that game starts, it’s never too early to get pumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video comes courtesy of Campus Insiders. It’s a little heavy on Clemson highlights (and light on Derrick Henry smashing through players or &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/29/derrick-henry-squat-weight.html&quot;&gt;lifting ridiculous amounts of weight&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chattahoochee flooding the highest in 12 years</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Chattahoochee River is overflowing, but not as much as it has before, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/river.php?wfo=ffc&amp;amp;wfoid=18694&amp;amp;riverid=204159&amp;amp;pt[]=151303&amp;amp;allpoints=144009%2C145755%2C146347%2C146046%2C148265%2C141510%2C144017%2C146057%2C148221%2C141577%2C148222%2C145815%2C143757%2C145502%2C146346%2C141767%2C151303%2C146625%2C142944&amp;amp;data[]=all&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Weather Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their water level gauge said the Chattahoochee has been above 27 feet for several days, the official minimum for “flooding.” As of this writing, it is at 28.5 feet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article52201700.html#storylink=mainstage&quot;&gt;more than enough to put parts of the RiverWalk underwater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is by all means the most significant flood Columbus has had in 12 years,” said Kent Frantz, a service hydrologist with the National Weather Service. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical data from the NWS reveals the current levels of flooding are comparable to other floods in the last 25 years with water levels such as 35.84 feet on at 12:30 p.m. on Christmas Day. Frantz said this year’s surge was the 18th-highest on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest crests, according to the records, were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;55.20 feet on March 15, 1929&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;52.60 feet on Dec. 12, 1919&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;49.80 feet on Feb. 26, 1961&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;48 feet on Jan. 19, 1925&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;45.89 feet on April 8, 1964&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those numbers have dropped in recent years because of development from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Georgia Power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The biggest thing is all of the dams that were built,” Frantz said, citing the Buford and West Point Dams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the NWS site, “moderate” flooding occurs at 42 feet. The flooding is rated is “major” once it crosses 47 feet. The river is “flooding” when it gets above 27 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frantz said 34 feet used to be the minimum for a flood until it was lowered to 27 to accommodate the Riverwalk and Phenix City Ampitheater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floods are rated and tracked by their potential to cause damage to the city, Frantz said. The NWS site includes a damage chart that estimates the costs of every extra foot of water. For example, the NWS guesses that 35 feet of flooding would expand upstream and downstream from the 14th Street Bridge. It would also put the Riverwalk under 8 feet of water and flood the maintenance room under the Trade Center up to 3 feet. “Portions of the Oxbow Creek Golf Course in south Columbus will be flooded,” according to the chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 45 feet, portions of Bay Avenue and 14th Street in Columbus and Second Avenue in Phenix City start flooding. Homes in low-lying areas of the Valley start seeing water from the Weracoba and Bull Creeks. The Phenix City Ampitheater would be completely flooded and large portions of the Alabama Riverwalk would be under 7 feet of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was very close [to causing more damage] at 36 feet,” Frantz said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;55 feet of flooding is considered “catastrophic” with “most bridges closed with extensive damage to homes and businesses.” Thankfully, the Chattahoochee &lt;a href=&quot;http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/crests.php?wfo=ffc&amp;amp;gage=cbug1&amp;amp;crest_type=historic&quot;&gt;does not appear to often reach those levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forecast for the next few days’ flooding has the river hovering around 28 feet through the New Year before dropping down to 25.3 feet by noon Jan. 4, depending on weather. A high pressure buildup and a few days’ break from rain should lower the water levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everything should finally have the chance to flow out,” Frantz said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Chitwood contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;columbus-floods-throughout-history&quot;&gt;Columbus floods throughout history&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1929&lt;/strong&gt;: The 1929 flood, according to Wes Owens’ article in a 1961 issue of the Sunday Ledger-Enquirer, saw waters rise more than halfway up the fence around Golden Park and flood the stands. Bay Street and Front Avenue were covered with several feet of water. The flood also knocked out the city’s gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1919&lt;/strong&gt;: The 1919 flood was known as the “Pershing Flood” because it coincided with Gen. John J. Pershing’s visit to Fort Benning. The area flooded again when Pershing visiting in 1922, causing him to quip, “I thought all along Columbus would make a good Army post, but I’m beginning to think it could also be used by the Navy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1841&lt;/strong&gt;: The Dillingham Street Bridge gave in to a flood in March 1841 locals called “the Harrison freshet” after the new president, William Henry Harrison. Two days of rain lifted one end of the bridge from its pier and floated ti downstream. The newspaper reported, “…never was there a more majestic sight seen, than the departure of that noble bridge, on its remarkable voyage. Its course was uninterrupted as we learn, until it reached Col. Woolfolk’s plantation, eight miles below, where it took up new moorings, in the centre of a large cotton field.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five ways to feel better and live better during the New Year</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As New Year’s Day approaches, it’s time to make changes and focus on personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, we’ve compiled a list of small things to do once a year that can help improve or tidy your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean out your closet&lt;/strong&gt;: Look through your clothes. Is there anything in there you haven’t worn in the last year? Why not? Would you wear it tomorrow? If not, do you really need it? Some outfits (formal wear or interview suits) might need to stay, but consider donating what you don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteer for the holidays&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the best things anyone can do around this time of year is volunteer to help others. Ask your church what they’re doing around town to help out, and help them. Charities always need time or money from those who can afford to give either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go somewhere unusual&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you eat at the same restaurant? Hang out at the same bar? Change it up! Regularity brings comfort in one hand and discontent in the other. Variety can help you see different people and break out of a rut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change the batteries on your smoke alarm&lt;/strong&gt;: There is nothing more infuriating than hearing a chirping noise from a smoke detector running out of power. Save yourself the frustration and change the batteries before they start beeping at you. Oh, and it’ll keep you safe from fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write down a list of what you’re proud of&lt;/strong&gt;: Obviously this varies from person to person, but people can be hard on themselves. Take a minute after the New Year’s Eve parties to write down five things you’re proud of doing or having. They can be personal accomplishments, relationships, whatever. It’s just good to remember all the good things.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 Videos from 2015&#39;s biggest stories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ledger-Enquirer staffers took a lot of video in 2015, from Sunday Interviews to breaking news. These were the six videos that turned the most heads. &lt;style&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;video-police-officer-body-cam-shows-him-shooting-suspect&quot;&gt;Video: Police officer body cam shows him shooting suspect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the most popular video this year was the raw footage showing a Columbus police officer shooting Towon Earl on Nov. 2. Earl was arrested after injuring three officers when he put his car into drive, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article43373514.html&quot;&gt;striking two and injuring a third&lt;/a&gt;. Four different police cameras captured Earl’s actions before he was shot. The Columbus Police Department says it is equipping more officers with the cameras in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article44944272.html&quot;&gt;three-month test program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;muscogee-county-jail-officials-inmate-get-in-fight&quot;&gt;Muscogee County jail officials, inmate get in fight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Columbus branch of the NAACP &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article29450245.html&quot;&gt;released video&lt;/a&gt; in May of a fight that happened on July 13, 2013, between an inmate of Muscogee County Jail and two officers. Christopher Russell, a diabetic, had complained to deputies about his meals arriving late, according to those involved. The two officers who allegedly attacked him, Deputy Anthony Ermi and Correctional Officer Anthony Merritt, were investigated. Ermi was suspended for 36 hours without pay. Merritt was terminated after being charged with an unrelated crime before the investigation was completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gunman who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article29489611.html&quot;&gt;killed two women and himself in a Louisiana movie theater&lt;/a&gt; in July was the same John Russell “Rusty” Houser who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/crime/article29490280.html&quot;&gt;vandalized and bobby-trapped the Phenix City house&lt;/a&gt; a Columbus man bought 18 months ago for his daughter out of foreclosure – years after they went to church with Houser and considered him incapable of such horror. Norman Bone, 77, and his daughter, Beth Bone, said the 32nd Street home still isn’t fit to be occupied a year and a half after police accompanied them to seize the house and evict Houser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8-year-old Eleck Stone donned his Army Combat Uniform and boots to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/military/article29435566.html&quot;&gt;spend time with the 3rd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment in March&lt;/a&gt;. Eleck, who has cystic fibrosis, was granted a two-day visit with the elite soldiers through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Although cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and digestive system, Eleck joined the Rangers on Thursday and Friday to fire weapons, wear night-vision equipment on a raid, ride in vehicles and take part in other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

Johnson showed no remorse and refused to apologize to Toms’ family and friends. He was sentenced to life without parole plus 10 years for the murder of Toms, manager of the Gold &amp;amp; Silver Trading Center, and a strong of armed robberies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The University of Alabama is testing fraternity brothers for drug use</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The University of Alabama has quietly started testing members of Greek organizations as part of an extensive mandatory screening program, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/university_of_alabama_quietly.html#incart_big-photo&quot;&gt;AL.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six current and former members of organizations such as Sigma Nu and Sigma Alpha Epsilon told the site the groups’ Alabama chapters require members to undergo periodic urinalysis “in order to maintain good standing with organizations and the school.” UA administration confirmed to AL.com that it is testing some Greek organizations without saying which ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brothers who fail or miss tests receive escalating warnings from their fraternity. If they fail or miss enough tests they can be kicked out of the organization and have the school notified.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s always useful to keep track of who’s mentioning your website on Twitter. You can see where the buzz is and engage with your fans, building community and hopefully driving more traffic to your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can keep track of anytime someone links to your website with some free web tools- it’s just a matter of connecting them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has a lot of advanced features under the hood. If you know where to look there’s a lot of great ways to find content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter accepts special search terms to narrow down content. You can search for tweets in a specific geographic area, tweets mentioning a topic, tweets to a person or tweets with a link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last bit is how you can track any time someone links to your website. Open TweetDeck and create a new column. Search for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“domain.com” filter:links -from:yourTwitterNameWithNo@ -from:yourWriters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “-from:name” can be repeated as many times as you’d like to filter out your own writers or employees. Obviously it’s not as big a deal if they’re tweeting out your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domain and link bit cuts it down to only tweets that include a link to your website. Twitter stores all links secretly as t.co links, but it still knows where they all link to and searches that. This search works across all link shorteners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-get-notified-when-someone-links-to-your-site-on-twitter&quot;&gt;How to get notified when someone links to your site on Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you don’t use TweetDeck, or maybe you’d rather have them notify you and not have to check a column yourself. To do that, we’re going to string together &lt;a href=&quot;https://warble.co/&quot;&gt;Warble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to set up a new email account to avoid having your email flooded with notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, sign into Warble and create a new alert. Input the same search as above. Whenever the results for that search change, Warble will email you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next-level system involved IFTTT. You can connect your email account within the system and set it to do something else whenever you get a new email from Warble. Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technorms.com/20934/create-powerful-connections-with-ifttt&quot;&gt;review of IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technorms.com/43294/10-clever-recipes-ifttt-do-apps&quot;&gt;10 clever recipes for the service&lt;/a&gt;. IFTTT is genius because you can have it do whatever you want when you get an email from Warble: text message, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pushbullet.com&quot;&gt;Pushbullet&lt;/a&gt;, another email (not sure why you’d want that), an Android or iPhone notification or a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;think-before-you-retweet&quot;&gt;Think before you retweet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair warning: I have found that you need to be careful with who you interact with on Twitter. They may have tweeted your story but they may not be someone you want associated with your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to also check the links they tweet to be sure they work- I saw one guy tweeting a “story” from us that was just a 404.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fascinating to see who tweets your stories and what they think of them. Hopefully this helps you grow your site and interact with your users.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to &#39;Y&#39;allywood&#39; (also known as Columbus, Georgia)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, Columbus is going into show business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Columbus State, the Springer Opera House and the state of Georgia are starting a special program to train Georgians to work on the sets of movies and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Springer artistic director Paul Pierce said film has become a $6 billion industry in Georgia because of the state’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/article29456854.html&quot;&gt;generous tax credits&lt;/a&gt;. With 157 feature films produced in this state in fiscal year 2015, Pierce said, there are more jobs in the movie industry than ever before. However, there aren’t enough Georgians to fill these jobs.&lt;style&gt;
#footnote_1 {

	-moz-animation-duration: .3s;
	animation-duration: .3s;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;fn_button&quot; onclick=&quot;showDiv_1()&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; left: 0px;&quot;&gt;•••
&lt;span class=&quot;footnoting animated fadeIn&quot; id=&quot;footnote_1&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/news/opinion/2015/03/06/what-wrong-with-film-industry-tax-incentives-they-don-work/wRzsGm3OegxBjDCgINEj9L/story.html&quot;&gt;major debate&lt;/a&gt; over whether these things actually work. I would love to explore that, but this story was already pushing it at a thousand words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
	var shown_1 = false;
	function showDiv_1() {
		if (document.getElementById(&#39;footnote_1&#39;).style.display 
			== &quot;none&quot;) {
			document.getElementById(&#39;footnote_1&#39;).style.display 
				= &quot;inline&quot;;
			document.getElementById(&#39;footnote_1&#39;).style.position 
				= &quot;absolute&quot;;
			document.getElementById(&#39;footnote_1&#39;).style.top = &quot;30px&quot;;
			document.getElementById(&#39;footnote_1&#39;).style.right = &quot;0px&quot;;
			document.getElementById(&#39;footnote_1&#39;).style.left = &quot;-120px&quot;;
			shown_1 = true;
		}
		else {
			document.getElementById(&#39;footnote_1&#39;).style.display = &quot;none&quot;;
			document.getElementById(&#39;footnote_1&#39;).className 
				= &quot;footnoting animated fadeIn&quot;;
			shown_1 = false;
		}
	}
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Georgia just doesn’t have the volume of scenic carpenters, scene painters, set decorators, lighting electricians, grips, prop masters, audio engineers or wardrobe professionals to crew all these films,” Pierce said. “Jets are landing in Hartsfield-Jackson every day with film workers from other states who are going directly to work sites. Gov. Deal is determined to put a stop to that, and we are determined to help him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deal invited Pierce to bring the Georgia Film Academy to Columbus. In just four weeks, a task force with representatives from CSU, the Springer, Columbus Tech, Columbus CVB, the Columbus Film Office and the Muscogee County School district put together a plan to meet the need for film-trained workers, according to Richard Baxter, dean of the College of the Arts at Columbus State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, CSU will offer a six-credit hour class starting Jan. 11 training 60 students in the basics of the film business. The class will use the Springer facilities. When students have learned about working on a set and know some of the equipment, they’ll spend a second 12-credit hour class working at Pinewood Studios in Fayette County on an actual film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baxter said students could put the credits toward their baccalaureate or take just those two semesters and leave with a certification. Students can take that certification to the Georgia Film Academy and get certified to work within a union on films anywhere in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“More and more film is coming to Georgia, and we’re happy to announce Columbus is going to be ground zero in the training of these new workers for these lucrative jobs,” Pierce said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSU will be one of only three schools in Georgia tasked by the Georgia Film Academy to offer these certifications (the other two are Clayton State University and Gwinnett Technical College).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baxter said the waiting list for this uncommon program is long enough that they’re working on a second section that will use Springer’s facilities on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the program will take advantage of Columbus’ capabilities to train students, working in most of Georgia’s film industry will take them outside the Chattahoochee Valley. There is no Columbus equivalent to the sound stages for movie-making like the ones in production in Effingham and Gwinnett Counties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We recognize this opportunity for Columbus means that we’re going to be training workers for the production studios outside of Columbus initially, but our hope is this cadre of talented students in the motion picture business will get the attention of those studios who will look to Columbus for their next project,” said Bill Murphy, executive vice president of economic development for the Greater Columbus Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Flowers, a music producer better known as Kevin Gr8 Trakz Lamar, tentatively guessed Columbus could get its own sound stage within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’ve been talking about this for the last year or so,” he said. “It’s going to be taken care of.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flowers said he was interested in working with students from the program. He said he already uses the CSU orchestra for producing film scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrence Manns, an independent filmmaker who works in Columbus, said he’s used Columbus State students for his job as well. He told the Ledger-Enquirer he wouldn’t mind hiring people straight out of the new program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was thinking of taking the program myself,” Manns said. “As a filmmaker, you can never stop learning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit of learning could result in a big payoff. Pierce said the jobs are so lucrative that even an entry-level position could pay $45 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flowers confirmed the pay scale, saying he’s charged $100 per hour on some projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other industries, the money depends on the specific job and hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payden Evans is a senior at Auburn University who works in the film industry. He’s worked as an extra and production assistant on shows like “The Vampire Diaries” and “Sleepy Hollow” and movies in the “Divergent” series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans said as a production assistant, he makes about $120 for a 12-hour shift. He said salaries in the movie industry vary by department and whether the person is in a union. Union rules mandate things like time-and-a-half pay for hours worked past a certain point and double pay on Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans said it while a program like CSU’s is not mandatory for joining the movie business, it can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s smart to have a working idea of set lingo and how things flow,” he said. “You don’t need it, but it’s not a bad idea. My learning curve was a lot steeper because I had a lot of lingo thrown at me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senior, who graduates Saturday with a degree in media studies, said breaking into the industry was tough. He attributes his chance to a fraternity brother with a family friend in the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie industry is great for those who want to get in, Evans said. It just requires an incredible amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the glitz and the glamor that’s on the screen,” he said. “It’s early mornings and late nights. I was on set at 4 a.m. and I wouldn’t get off until 6 to 8 at night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job isn’t regular like a 9-5 either. Evans said working on a TV show could mean nine months of work. A movie could be anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To students who want to get into that business, Evans advised persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do what is asked of you and do more if you can,” Evans said. “People take note of hard work… Georgia is a great place to be if (film is) something you’re into. Go for it. The opportunity is there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credit to the Columbus, Georgia Film Office for the title. They claim “industry insiders” call Georgia’s burgeoning film industry ‘Y’allywood.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why it’s a highlight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a big story for our area. Georgia’s film industry is big business. However, we need to ask who is getting the benefit of that business. CSU and Springer are selling this program on $45/hr for entry-level jobs, and that’s just not what everyone will get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I consider this a good story because it covers an important event while offering another perspective for some realism. Maybe these kids really will get $45/hr, I don’t know. But they do deserve to hear what it’s really like from someone who’s not trying to sell them an 18-credit hour class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>This song about Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson is awful and amazing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson drew my attention this morning when he tweeted his thanks to a band for writing a song about… Sen. Johnny Isakson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Wow, never had a song written about me. Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PapaRazziAndThePhotogs?src=hash&quot;&gt;#PapaRazziAndThePhotogs&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m undeserving but flattered nonetheless. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SdPaMKVgOI&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SdPaMKVgOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Johnny Isakson (@SenatorIsakson) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenatorIsakson/status/672423470349832192&quot;&gt;December 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve linked another copy of the song below, and it is… something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8f1ysdH3GQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The singer is an odd duck. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://noisey.vice.com/blog/This-Genius-Lunatic-Has-Recorded-16000-Songs-About-Everything-from-Poop-to-Ellen-Degeneres&quot;&gt;Vice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Matt Farley is a guy in his mid-30s living in Northeastern Massachusetts. He runs an entertainment company called Motern Media that manages about 70 bands that together have recorded just over 16,000 songs. The thing is, he also plays in all of the bands and sings in all of the bands and is the only person in all of them. Motern Media is Matt Farley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy churns out an average of 20 songs per day. It’s all weird stuff designed to pick up people searching weird terms for very specific songs. He makes a little bit of money every time you search for a song about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SLX_qO1uvQ&quot;&gt;knowing how to tie a tie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBfX9ucGXNU&quot;&gt;how great Robert Downey, Jr. is&lt;/a&gt;. It works, too- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2014/jan/29/spotify-how-a-busy-songwriter-youve-never-heard-of-makes-it-work-for-him&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; said Farley makes $23,000 a year from his entire catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song about Johnny Isakson comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/u.s.-senators/id954900502&quot;&gt;an album of songs about U.S. Senators&lt;/a&gt;. Why does that exist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mixed reaction among Columbus residents to women in combat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Women are joining men on the front lines of combat, and some people in Columbus are okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An informal poll revealed support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/nation-world/article47724225.html#storylink=mainstage&quot;&gt;the decision&lt;/a&gt;, with a few qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Women should be allowed to do anything that they can,” said Margie Watson, of Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watson said she hopes the military holds men and women to the same standards and doesn’t change them just because women are allowed in combat positions. She said she was also concerned about the physical ability of women to fight on the frontlines because they are not as strong as men “for the most part.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Manzi, who was visiting from Denver, said he could think of a few women who were strong enough to meet the combat standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I work out twice a day, five days a week, and some of the women [in the gym] are impressive,” Manzi said. “If they want to do it and they can do it, that’s great.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manzi said he supported the decision and would not change anything about it. He pointed to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/military/article39389271.html&quot;&gt;first three women to graduate Ranger School&lt;/a&gt; as an example of what female soldiers can do if given the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley Meadows, a master’s student in history at Columbus State, said she approved of opening combat positions to women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a huge, huge step,” she said. “It is equal to women earning the right to vote.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meadows qualified her support as well, citing concerns about physiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are built different,” she said. “There’s no denying that one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Meadows said she expected female soldiers would overcome physical limitations through training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lester Mahone said he did not approve of women being on the front lines. He told the Ledger-Enquirer it would be better to keep them in non-combat support roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s too dangerous for a woman,” he said. “It’s really not a lady thing. It’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His wife Lisa Mahone agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let the men do the fighting,” she said. “We need our women out here to help our men.”&lt;/p&gt;
