        <title>Sergeant in marshals honored for rushing into house fire while injured</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sgt. Kurt Weathered of the Muscogee County Marshals was honored with the department’s first-ever Medal of Bravery at the Government Center Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img class=&quot;inline capped &quot; src=&quot;/blog/assets/1125_COLO_fire2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kevin Flowers, left, lost his home to a fire. Kurt Weatherd, right, said he rushed inside the home to make sure Flowers wasn&#39;t asleep inside.&quot; /&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Kevin Flowers, left, lost his home to a fire. Kurt Weatherd, right, said he rushed inside the home to make sure Flowers wasn&#39;t asleep inside.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weathered said he was on his couch at home, recovering from surgery on his Achilles tendon and about to watch “Gunsmoke,” when he saw smoke coming from his neighbor’s house. He said he put his boot on his bad foot and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/25/man-rushes-burning-house.html&quot;&gt;hopped across the street without crutches into the house&lt;/a&gt;. He said he was afraid his neighbor Kevin Flowers was asleep inside the burning house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are here because Sergeant Weathered saw the need to lay down his own life and go into a burning house to save the life of his friend and neighbor,” said Muscogee County Marshal Greg Countryman. “He did not know if he would come out of that burning house. This was a very heroic act.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his bravery, Weathered received the Medal of Bravery. Countryman said the department has had the award but never given it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We never do anything expecting to get anything in return,” Weathered said. “It means a lot to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weathered said he tried to open the door by smashing a window with his ASP baton. When he saw the door had a chain on it, he hopped in front of it, stood on his boot and used his good foot to smash open the front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick search of the living room revealed a collapsing ceiling but not Flowers. Weathered ran back outside, got a flashlight from his wife Angela and went back into the house. He said he kicked down the bedroom door looking for Flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My heart dropped because I thought he was on the bed,” Weathered said, choking up as he spoke at the ceremony. “He wasn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Weathered saw Flowers’ car was not in the garage, he left the house. Flowers told the Ledger-Enquirer he was at the bank at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I just thank God for giving me the courage not to follow my mind saying, ‘Man, get out of here. It’s hot,’” Weathered said. “Thank god for my training. I’m just glad (Flowers) is safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weathered said he was also glad to provide a &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/09/stickers.html&quot;&gt;positive example of public service&lt;/a&gt; to contrast with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/nation-world/article46184715.html&quot;&gt;negative news about law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to do some good because that’s what you signed up for,” he said. “The badge that you wear don’t make you a god. It sets you out to be that example and be that one to help when someone’s in need.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hundreds fed at Valley Rescue Mission</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Volunteers and needy families filled the large white tent by Valley Rescue Mission on Thanksgiving to both give and be served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I just really wanted to serve the Lord,” said Kathy Hutto, who drove in from LaGrange to help. “He’s been really good to me lately and I wanted to serve Him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitzi Oxford, the Mission’s development director, estimates that they served more than 800 people at the tent. The women and children’s center, Damascus Way, also fed everyone at the shelter and delivered meals to more than 300 elderly shut-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event required more than 100 volunteers, donations from around the community and a great deal of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0_thanksgiving_charity&quot; title=&quot;Thanksgiving charity&quot; src=&quot;//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?y1o&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Masterbuilt smoked more than 100 turkeys so the Downtown Rotary Club could de-bone them. Summerville Road Baptist Church delivered desserts, and St. Luke School made the table centerpieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abigail Pritchett, 10, came with her grandparents Christopher and Debbie Kearns from Ellersly to help serve others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I just love to see their happy faces,” Pritchett said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hutto agreed, calling it “a worthwhile trip.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lonely, poor and addicted invited to charitable Thanksgiving</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Trevor Morris just wanted to help some people for Thanksgiving. On Monday, he posted to Facebook that his restaurant, the Trevioli Artisan Pasta Company, would close to the public and instead open to people who needed a good Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;fb-root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = &quot;//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3&quot;;  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, &#39;script&#39;, &#39;facebook-jssdk&#39;));&lt;/script&gt;

Conversely, we will be opening our doors to the less...&lt;/p&gt;Posted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Trevioli-artisan-pasta-company-648844985150099/&quot;&gt;Trevioli artisan pasta company&lt;/a&gt; on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1189041907797068&amp;amp;id=648844985150099&amp;amp;substory_index=0&quot;&gt;Monday, November 23, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post, which Facebook said was viewed by more than 50,000 people, attracted around a dozen customers and 20-25 volunteers in the first hour. The event was Thursday from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company gave away food donated by groups around the Valley. Morris estimated he could feed up to 500 with everything he had received. He said he wasn’t sure what to do with the extra food, but would probably give it to another charity or hand it out to the needy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first time Morris has tried something like this charitable Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said it was just something good he wanted to try, especially after experiencing the other end of charity as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was a time in my life when I was on the other side of the coin, when I was in line to get a free meal,” Morris said. “I was thankful to whoever did it. So I feel like if you can, you should.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant owner said he grew up in a family with a lot of kids and little money. Welfare, food stamps and free lunches at school were what Morris said got his family by. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article29435938.html&quot;&gt;Job Spotlight from March 2015&lt;/a&gt;, he also told the Ledger-Enquirer his upbringing included a mother addicted to drugs and his own depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I remember that there was a local bakery that would find needy families like ours and they would bring stuff by all the time,” Morris said. “I always thought that was super cool as a kid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natalie Blackwell, 26, said she volunteered to help the dinner as part of a joint decision with her mother. Her brother is in Atlanta and her mother is in South Carolina and they could not get together for Thanksgiving. Instead, Blackwell and her mother decided to do charity for the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s the whole purpose of Thanksgiving,” Blackwell said. “What better way is there to give back?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morris said he asked for the lonely and anxious to visit as well because of the problems associated with the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the time of the year where your suicide rate goes up,” he said. “If there’s a chance that somebody came in today who needed just one more day of being around people to save them from going over the edge or relapsing or suicide or whatever, it would be so awesome if we could be something that prevents that from happening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antoine Gardner, 31, was arrested and charged with possession of Schedule IV and II drugs and possession of a Walther .22 pistol, the report said. Police are not planning a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police were looking for Jillian Holloway, 13, and Jessica Hardie, 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement emailed this afternoon, Detective Richard Campbell of the special victims unit reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They were located in Panama City Beach. They are fine. Their parents are on their way to Florida to pick them up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Florida NBC TV affiliate WJHG reported Wednesday afternoon the teenage girls were found at Reid’s Court on Front Beach Road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Columbus police reported that they went to a home in the 900 block of 42nd Street to serve a violation of parole warrant to Darren Rathel, 47. Police said they were let into the residence by Rathel’s mother and found Rathel hiding inside a closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an officer searched Rathel’s bedroom, he found 2 grams of suspected crystal methamphetamines, 0.5 grams of suspected cocaine, 1 gram of suspected marijuana, a digital scale, marijuana grinder and a glass smoking device, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police said Rathel was arrested and charged with possession of Schedule II drugs, possession of marijuana and drug-related items.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Man rushes into neighbor&#39;s burning house on one foot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A house at the corner of Lantern Lane and Lantern Court caught fire Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Flowers, who lives in the house, said he was at the bank for less than an hour when he started getting “a whole lotta calls.” He said he does not know why or how the fire began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurt Weatherd, a sergeant in the Muscogee County Marshals, said he called 911 at 12:49 p.m. when he saw a lot of smoke coming from Flowers’ house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weatherd said he recently had surgery on his achilles tendon and could put a little pressire on his right foot, but not much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This did not stop Weatherd from going across the street to open Flowers’ door and rushing inside to look for him, even when it meant hopping on one leg. He said he had to bust down a few doors with his good leg to check the bedroom and garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My main concern was whether (Flowers) was inside asleep,” Weatherd said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weatherd, who is ex-military, said he didn’t hesitate to go into the burning building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stuff like this, it’s our job to run one way when everyone else is running the other,” he said. “When you got family, you don’t think about yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battalion Chief Bobby Dutton said it took the fire department an hour to put after it got into the attic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutton said the cause of the fire was still under investigation. He couldn’t put a number on the cost of the damages, only that the house was a total loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s bad that it happened the day before Thanksgiving, but we’re just glad nobody got hurt,” Dutton said.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Columbus police searching for murder suspect</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Columbus police have released the name of the man suspected of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/24/shooting-murder-cusseta.html&quot;&gt;Monday’s fatal shooting of Marcus Bowden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police said a murder warrant has been issued for Demartre Trevon Harris, 22. He is a 5-foot-10, 170-pound black male with brown eyes and black hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This suspect should be considered armed and dangerous,” Lt. John R. McMichael of the Robbery and Homicide Division of Columbus police said in a release. “Anyone with information about this suspect or about the incident is asked to contact Robbery/Homicide at 706-653-3400.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Bowden, 30, was shot in the stomach multiple times Monday morning around 11:24 a.m. Bowden was taken to Midtown Medical Center and pronounced dead at 12:35 p.m. He had multiple gunshots to his lower body. Chief Deputy Coroner Freeman Worley told the Ledger-Enquirer he could not say the official cause of death before an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McMichael said Bowden’s body will be taken to the State Crime Lab for an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Police- Victim dies after second shooting reported near Cusseta Road</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;About 18 hours after two men were shot, another man was killed Tuesday afternoon in second shooting in the same block of Cusseta Road, Columbus authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Bowden, 30, was pronounced dead at 12:35 p.m. at Midtown Medical Center, said Muscogee County Chief Deputy Coroner Freeman Worley. Columbus police said Bowden was taken to the hospital by ambulance after he was shot in the stomach around 11 a.m. His body will be sent to the crime lab for an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police are looking for an older model white Ford Explorer with dark tinted windows. Anyone with information is asked to call 706-653-3400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homicide came hours after two men were shot near the same house in the 2900 block of Cusseta Road, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police said two people were injured in a shooting around 6:15 p.m. Monday. One victim suffered from two gunshot wounds to the thigh and shin or calf, police said. The second victim had a gunshot wound to the back of the left thigh. Both were taken Midtown Medical Center and are listed in fair condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No description of a suspect was given and the shooting remains under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report said it is unknown if the shootings are gang-related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We see a lot of drugs being sold on this corner,” said Willie Phillips, who works with Winterfield on the Move Against Drugs. “We have a gang problem. People continue to sell drugs. … (The police and mayor) could do more and they will do more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man was also robbed at 7:46 p.m. in the 1900 block of Cusseta Road on the same day the two men were shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Columbus police said a robber pointed a pistol at the victim and told him to “give it up.” The report does not list what was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowden is the 17th homicide in Columbus this year. His death follows the early Saturday shooting death of 23-year-old Christopher Twitty at his Wickham Drive home.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>National Infantry Museum to reopen theater and provide free multimedia show</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Infantry Museum has completed a $1.8 million renovation of its theater to allow more flexible use of its 289-sear auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIM will feature “The New American Freedom Train” in the new theater on Dec. 3, 2015. The show will feature Nashville recording artist Tim Maggart with a band and “an inspiring and patriotic multimedia show.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s the perfect event for introducing the new theater,” said NIM Foundation president Ben Williams. “And it will appeal to our audiences, who share Tim Maggart’s appreciation for the military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show begins at 7 p.m. on Dec. 3. Admission is free, but guests must reserve tickets in advance by calling (706) 494 - 3708.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show will take advantage of several renovations, including a new digital projection system. The 6P Christie Laser Projection System is installed in only two other American theaters, according to the NIM’s release. The Giant Screen Theater will be the first in the Southeast to use laser projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be a new documentary on Dec. 4 called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://spacenextmovie.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Space Next&lt;/a&gt;” that covers “mankind’s pursuit to reach the stars” in addition to a showing of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338348/&quot;&gt;The Polar Express 3D&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be two showings of “Polar Express” on Saturday, Dec. 5. The release said The Conductor will be back punching golden tickets at select screenings. On Dec. 12, Muscogee Moms will help run two Polar Express Pajama Parties with free holiday crafts for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the NIM’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalinfantrymuseum.org/special-events/&quot;&gt;full schedule&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
