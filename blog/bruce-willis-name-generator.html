<p>As pointed out Blank Check's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/griffin-and-david-present/glass" target="new"><em>Glass</em> episode</a>, Bruce Willis has been in a lot of weird and bad movies. Meet his quote and he'll appear in your knockoff of a knockoff of <em>Taken</em>.</p>

<p>I threw this together in an evening for fun, but I am trying to change careers into web development. If you know someone in the Denver area hiring entry-level full-stack developers with Angular 6 experience, my contact info is in the footer. Definitely get in touch if you also listen to Blank Check!</p>
