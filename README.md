## About this project

I set this website up to show my journalistic work to potential employers. This GitHub repository is set up as a way to view my abilities with HTML and CSS as well. I'm no expert, but I know enough to create modify code extensively into a something useful for other projects, such as unique stories on the web. 

Feel free to look through the code and assets. They're a work in progress- I'm still building the site and fixing the assets. 

### Progress report 7-23-15

The homepage is basically finished. The content works, it fits on desktop and mobile, and I have most of the materials I'd like. Might need some more photos. Also still not entirely happy with the gradient background.

I've also rehosted several of my best stories from previous jobs. News stories tend not to live long on the web, especially stuff you wrote two jobs ago. I'm copying over my collection of PDFS I saved of my published work into native HTML that's easy to read and easy to load. 

### Progress report 7-21-15

I've finished the majority of the site layout and content on the main page. I plan to spice up the colors for the landing page and add text copies of my old stories (which will take much longer). 

Ideally, I'll have a complete archive of what I've written for you lovely potential employers. We'll see how it goes.
