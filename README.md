## About this site

I originally built this website to store previous articles I'd written. You can still read those, but its primary purpose now is to keep a portfolio of my web development projects. 

## Tech

This site uses Jekyll 3 to generate static HTML files. There is a little client-side JS to toggle night mode, because I love dark modes. 

The heaviest lifting is done by my [related posts algoritm](https://github.com/kyle-n/kyle-n.github.io/blob/master/_includes/related_posts.html), which adds related stories based off my tags. This was very hard to do with a templating language, as you might imagine.
