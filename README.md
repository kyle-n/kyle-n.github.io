## About this project

I created this website to show my journalistic work to potential employers. This GitHub repository is also set up as a way to view my abilities with HTML and CSS as well. I'm no expert, but I know enough to create modify code extensively into a something useful for other projects. 

Feel free to look through the code and assets. They're mostly finished, though I'm ironing out the bugs.

### Progress report 2-17-16

I've stopped adding features to the site. Now it's just a matter of keeping it updated with new stories and making sure nothing breaks. 

### Progress report 9-17-15

The website is mostly finished. I've set up all the features I want for rehosting my stories. I've managed to get Facebook and Twitter robust sharing working (no mean feat, given how finicky Facebook's crawler is). Now I'm just fixing bugs as they pop up, trying to boost my spot on Google and updating the site with more stories as they come in. 

### Progress report 8-31-15

I have rebuilt the site with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. This will allow me to manage my content without having to manually build every HTML page while still serving up a static site. 

Static sites are preferable because they are fast and take up little bandwidth. The site should load quickly on mobile and tablets. 

### Progress report 7-28-15

Started work on using Jekyll, a static site generator, to create a blog for rehosting my old stories. I can't keep manually creating the HTML for them. There's an easier way to automate that. It's also terrible when I want to change one thing and have to go through and change it for all the stories. 

### Progress report 7-23-15

The homepage is basically finished. The content works, it fits on desktop and mobile, and I have most of the materials I'd like. Might need some more photos. Also still not entirely happy with the gradient background.

I've also rehosted several of my best stories from previous jobs. News stories tend not to live long on the web, especially stuff you wrote two jobs ago. I'm copying over my collection of PDFS I saved of my published work into native HTML that's easy to read and easy to load. 

### Progress report 7-21-15

I've finished the majority of the site layout and content on the main page. I plan to spice up the colors for the landing page and add text copies of my old stories (which will take much longer). 

Ideally, I'll have a complete archive of what I've written for you lovely potential employers. We'll see how it goes.
