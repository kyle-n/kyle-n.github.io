## About this project

I set this website up to show my journalistic work to potential employers. This GitHub repository is set up as a way to view
my abilities with HTML and CSS as well. I'm no expert, but I know enough to create modify code extensively into a something
useful for other projects, such as unique stories on the web. 

Feel free to look through the code and assets. They're a work in progress- I'm still building the site and fixing the assets.
