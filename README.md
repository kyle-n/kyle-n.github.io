## About this site

I originally built this back when I was a journalist to show off my portfolio. Now it's a lovely advertisement for my abilities as a frontend developer. Please do get in touch if you're interested. 

## Technology

I know other technologies are the new hotness in static site generation, but I like Jekyll for its simple templating, fast builds and great GitHub Pages integration. Much obliged for the free hosting!
