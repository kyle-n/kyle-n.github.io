        <title>Georgia and Alabama earn failing grades in government corruption index</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Georgia state government is the 24th-least corrupt in the nation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/09/18367/georgia-gets-d-grade-2015-state-integrity-investigation&quot;&gt;according to the Center for Public Integrity&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit investigative journalism group. The rating is an improvement from three years ago when the state was rated dead last on a different scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Center praised 2013’s Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Act, which limited gifts to individual lawmakers at $75.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lawmakers and lobbyists are adjusting to the new reality,” the report said. “For the most part, the swanky steak dinners and “educational” golfing trips have been replaced by more modest expenditures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the law does not require state employees to register as lobbyists. This allows members of the government, such as employees at public universities, to lobby lawmakers without being subject to the $75 gift limit. State employees can give football tickets to politicians, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can’t get tickets to the Falcons, but [the University of Georgia] can say here are tickets to the president’s box,” said UGA political science professor Charles Bullock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia also earned poor marks for a weak ethics agency and restricting access to what should be open records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Georgia’s shortcomings in oversight and accountability pose a continued risk for corruption and unethical conduct in state government, and the State Integrity Investigation shows that improvements over the past few years are largely incremental,” the Center said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/09/18322/alabama-gets-d-grade-2015-state-integrity-investigation&quot;&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; actually earned the seventh-highest place on the list with a D+ ranking. Its grade was brought down by the widespread and rampant corruption among its politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Two of Alabama’s past six governors have been convicted while in office and sent to prison, one on a bribery conviction he still is appealing and the other for appropriating inaugural campaign funds for personal use,” the Center said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alabama’s rating also dropped because of the trial of Auburn representative and Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard. Hubbard, after championing an ethics law, was charged with 23 felonies under that same law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/09/18822/how-does-your-state-rank-integrity&quot;&gt;Read the evaluations for all 50 states.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Video- Alabama student tased and beaten by Tuscaloosa police after noise complaint</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Internal affairs investigators for the Tuscaloosa Police Department are looking into officers reportedly beating and tasing an Alabama student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tuscaloosa police said the incident occurred on Nov. 8 at 3:19 a.m. and happened because of a loud music call, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cw.ua.edu/article/2015/11/video-shows-police-using-taser-on-ua-student&quot;&gt;Crimson White&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos of the incident were released on Twitter Sunday ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/petepajor/status/663516103377817600&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coyotehunter25/status/663544355748257793&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kelloggskling/status/663507438298116097&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Np53t79rQ4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). The videos show several Tuscaloosa police officers dragging a man out of an apartment before using a stun gun on him and hitting him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://totalfratmove.com/police-beating-tasing-in-tuscaloosa/&quot;&gt;Total Frat Move&lt;/a&gt; said the student has been charged with harassment, obstruction and resisting arrest. He declined to comment to the Crimson White about the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A full investigation of the circumstances that are depicted in these videos will be conducted and all appropriate measures taken to ensure the integrity of the Tuscaloosa Police Department in serving the citizens of Tuscaloosa,” police said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>See the Sibley Horticultural Center at Callaway Gardens for free before it closes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Callaway Gardens will admit all guests for free this Friday in honor of the birthday of founder Cason J. Callaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be an organ concert from noon to 4 p.m. at the Ida Cason Callaway Memorial Chapel to mark the occasion, according to a release. The concert will be played on a custom-built Möller pipe organ in a chapel that was designed and built as a tribute to Ida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.callawaygardens.com/events/2015-11-06&quot;&gt;day calendar&lt;/a&gt; on the website also lists a free birds of prey show featuring owls, hawks and other raptors at 10:30 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be a classic Southern buffet between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. at The Plant Room Restaurant. Cost to attend is $25.95 per adult and $12.50 per child ages 6-10. Children 5 and under are free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free admission comes just days before Callaway Gardens’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/business/article41968617.html&quot;&gt;planned closure&lt;/a&gt; of the Sibley Horticultural Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The closure of the Sibley Horticultural Center is a measure that allows us to focus on a better gardens experience and put the polish on another jewel, the Day Butterfly Center,” said William “Bill” Doyle III, president and CEO. “That work is already under way, with measurable progress by mid- to late-November. Guests should mark their calendars to visit this spring to see the new, colorful displays.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cason’s Vegetable Garden has already been closed, apparently to be relocated. It and the Sibley Center have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.callawaygardens.com/about-us/history/timeline&quot;&gt;long histories&lt;/a&gt; at Callaway Gardens, which was founded out of farm and forest lands in 1952 by Cason J. and Virginia Hand Callaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sibley Center is located on five ares and was built with private donations. It uses 300 tons of Tennessee fieldstone, 7,000 glass blocks and 26 folding doors. Each door is 24 feet tall and weighs 1,600 pounds. There is also a 22-foot waterfall with 350 gallons of water cascading downward each minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facility, at one time marketed by Callaway Gardens as “one of the most advanced garden/greenhouse complexes in the world,” is about 22,000 square feet, with an additional 30,000 square feet of greenhouse production space. The complex, with floral and plant displays inside and out, underwent a $3.5 million renovation in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Red Cross needs blood during the holidays</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The American Red Cross is encouraging people around Columbus and Phenix City to donate blood during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A seasonal decline in donations often occurs from Thanksgiving to New Year’s Day when donors get busy with family gatherings and travel,” a spokeswoman said in a release. “However, patients don’t get a holiday vacation from needing lifesaving transfusions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who donates between Nov. 25 and Nov. 29 will receive a Red Cross mixing spoon and celebrity chef recipe set while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Cross said donors of all blood types are needed, especially those with O-negative, B-negative, A-negative and AB blood. Anyone who would like to donate needs a blood donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of identification. You must be at least 17, weigh 110 pounds and be in “generally good health.” High school students and other donors 18 and younger may also have to meet “certain height and weight requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make an appointment to donate blood, download the Red Cross Blood Donor App (Android and iPhone), visit the Red Cross’ website or call 1-800-733-2767.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release also listed several blood donation opportunities at these times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11/16/2015: 11 a.m. - 7 p.m., Columbus Blood Donation Center, 7490 Veterans Parkway&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>This family lost their home in a fire, but the community gave back</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the Robinson family, Halloween was Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthony St. Pierre, a Columbus firefighter paramedic, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/29/batman.html&quot;&gt;collected donations&lt;/a&gt; of toys, blankets and clothing for the family for the past month. On Halloween, he presented the family with the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Robinsons have had a hard month. On Sept. 15, Tuesday, John Robinson’s mother passed away. Her funeral was on Friday. On Saturday, the Robinson’s rental trailer caught fire. Sunday was Robin’s fifth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We lost it all,” John said. “Every bit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John said what wasn’t ruined by the fire was stolen when the family was living out of a motel. He said the “scavengers” took kitchen appliances, DVD players (only one worked) and a TV bought for $3 at a garage sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St. Pierre said when he saw Raven Rose Robinson, 2, and Robin Renee Robinson, 5, he thought of his own children and wanted to give them a good Halloween. He originally planned to have the kids go to fire stations all over Columbus for a private trick-or-treat, but the Robinson parents John and Jessica decided it would be better to stay at fire station #4 on North Oakley Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their private Halloween, Robin and Raven dressed up as princesses. St. Pierre, a comic book fan, came as Batman. His friend Caitlin Norton drove in from Atlanta and dressed as Batgirl to help present the donations to the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/incoming/article42072678.html/video-embed&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The oldest one, Robin, she almost started crying when she saw all of this,” Norton said. “Even Raven was starting to cry because all of the stuff was for them. That’s what it’s all about right there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin and Raven got to play with dozens of toys donated by people as far away as Los Angeles and Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St. Pierre said news of the family’s plight spread over social media and inspired an outpouring of donations. He said he filled up one of the ambulances several times over with all the blankets and toys people donated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“(This) gives our girls things they haven’t had for a month,” John said. “We appreciate it. It’s nice to see people willing to help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to donate gently used goods or toys, drop them off at the fire station at 200 North Oakley Drive, Columbus, GA 31907.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eufaula latex plant to restart under Steve Harvey, Greg Calhoun</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Comedian Steve Harvey and Montgomery businessman Greg Calhoun are reopening a latex plant in Eufaula next year, according to Calhoun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to put people back to work,” Calhoun said. “It’s a blessed opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calhoun, who has been friends with Steve Harvey for 15 years, said the two were interested in Eufaula because it has the only latex plant in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eufaula Mayor Jack Tibbs Jr. said the plant now known as Ameritex closed down in 2008 when it lost its contract with USAID producing condoms for AIDS prevention. Tibbs estimated that contract was 95 percent of the plant’s business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calhoun said he plans to have the factory produce mostly latex gloves for major organizations such as Wal-Mart, the Transportation Security Administration, poultry producers and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he’s already spoken with Rob Walton, chairman of Wal-Mart, who has indicated interest in buying gloves from the factory as part of the retailer’s initiative to move jobs back to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calhoun said he hopes to have the first two lines operational by January 2016 and the whole plant online in four phases through 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Calhoun said it was “nice to have Wal-Mart to start out with,” he doesn’t plan on having only one major customer like the plant did before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“(Walton) didn’t want to be our only customer,” Calhoun said. “He wanted us to get out there and find others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calhoun said the output from one line in Ameritex could supply Wal-Mart, leaving several others for different customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Bradley, director of economic development for the city of Eufaula, said there are about 10 people working on retooling the four production lines to make them ready to produce latex gloves instead of condoms. He said only one of the four was already set up to do gloves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tibbs said there is a great deal of excitement for the plant, which is estimated to bring 300 jobs over two years. Each line will require 65-70 people, plus supervisors, management and warehouse employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bradley said the plant will slowly staff up as more of it comes online. He estimates that 27 people will be working there on Jan. 4, 2016, and 100 by the end of 2016. By 2018, there should be 350 people hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a long, complicated process, but Mr. Harvey and Mr. Calhoun have a terrific vision for the future of latex,” Bradley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tibbs said he was happy to see jobs returning to Alabama and especially Eufaula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“(Harvey) can be a serious guy,” Tibbs said. “He wants to put people back to work.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>That Secret Society letter is as fake as it sounds</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Better Business Bureau sent out a warning about a scam that may show up in postal service mailboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter from the “Secret Society” asks for $135 for “10 miracles that will transform your life,” including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slim down to a body others will envy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Become a genius&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlock your hidden creativity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Live as a VIP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make $5,000 a month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The service offers to send you a Secret Manuscript explaining how to obtain these rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bureau called the whole system a pyramid scheme that would require victims to recruit more people into the scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bureau advised consumers to avoid letters that offer pie-in-the-sky statements, say they’ll give benefits if you recruit others, ask that you keep information confidential, or require you to send a check or credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always with scams: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Traveling, the way he would have wanted</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;William Nathan Thomas Daniels died too soon.&lt;!--break--&gt; The 23-year-old Phenix City resident ran off Randolph County Road 82 at 6 a.m. and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.al.com/news/anniston-gadsden/index.ssf/2015/10/phenix_city_man_killed_when_ve.html&quot;&gt;struck an embankment&lt;/a&gt;. He was pronounced dead at the scene by Alabama state troopers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of the beloved son, older brother and boyfriend turned his loved ones’ world upside down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overton said she met Daniels at his house in Phenix City on June 14, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was instant,” she said. “He told me within the first week we were soulmates. I thought he was crazy. I just shrugged it off… [but] it didn’t take me long before I realized he was onto something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overton and Daniels connected over a shared love of travel and music. They loved discovering new bands together and sharing them with the other person. They had already booked a hotel and bought tickets to a Zeds Dead concert in Nashville in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/overton2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overton said the two wanted to wait to have kids until their 30s so they could travel the world. They made plans to go to Europe the following year. Daniels, an Army brat who moved around the world, spent three years in Baumholder, Germany, when he was a baby and wanted to visit again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple had planned to rent a house in LaGrange in February. They’d already picked out a favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overton said she loved Daniels’ passion for life, travel, music and his small circle of close friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If he loved you, then you knew it,” Overton said. “He gave it his all in everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overton said when she collected his possessions after the wreck, she pressed play on his Galaxy S6 and received a shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was in the middle of a song… it was our band,” she said. “The whole band was about love and passion and that one song was about losing that love. It was just bone-chilling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overton said she wants to make sure William Nathan Thomas Daniels is remembered. She is planning a cross-country road trip with his ashes. Daniels’ father Tom Daniels said he hopes he can go for some of the trip, if circumstances allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overton’s plan starts with renting a car and driving out to El Paso, Texas, where Daniels lived. After that, Las Vegas and Fort Irvin, Calif., where Daniels was born. From there she’ll drive up to Portland, Ore., and Seattle, where one of Daniels’ friends lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/r76j58ws&quot;&gt;GoFundMe drive&lt;/a&gt; to help collect money for the trip. If Overton raises enough, she is thinking about flying to Germany and spending time in Europe. She said they had planned to go to Italy next summer. She’d love to see the country and backpack around as much as possible. Overton does not plan to leave until next spring break, so the plans are still in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overton said she’s also applied for as many overtime shifts as is legally possible at her job as a lab assistant at Columbus Regional Medical Center. It helps save money for the trip and keep her mind off of her loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I just want to go as many places as I possibly can,” Overton said. “It is my last gift to him. It’s something I want to do to make sure he’s remembered. I don’t want him to just go away. I don’t want him to just sit up on a shelf and collect dust. I want him to be where his heart wanted to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Videos filmed for heroin project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The effects of heroin addiction, as told by those involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I filmed these videos while assisting Ledger reporter Alva James-Johnson with her Red Ribbon Week series on heroin addiction. The paper does not have any professional video equipment, so I jury-rigged a tripod stand for an iPad Air 2 and filmed heroin addict Joseph Sibold in the quietest room the jail had. &lt;/p&gt;
