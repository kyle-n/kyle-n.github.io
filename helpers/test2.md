2019 was not as great a year for movies. There was a lot of weird crap this year, which is a shame given [how great last year was]({% post_url 2019-01-09-favorite-movies-2018 %}).

This year I've included ratings according to my personal rating system!

★ = Did not like
★★ = Fine, whatever
★★★ = Good!
★★★★ = Really good, would recommend wholeheartedly
★★★★★ = I love this movie (Rarely given out - last year's 5-★ movies were *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*, *Annihilation*, *Hereditary* and *Black Panther*. 

## The worst of the worst

### XX: *Dark Phoenix* | ★

The rare movie I actually despise. *Dark Phoenix* is an irredeemable trash heap. Sophie Turner might have been able to do *Game of Thrones*, but she is not a movie star. One of the worst performances of the year. 

I cannot wait for Marvel to do the X-Men right and put this godforsaken version of one of my favorite comics into the ground.

### XX: *What Men Want* | ★

Look, no disrespect to Taraji P. Henson, who does [interesting projects](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6421110/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_9) and deserves all the star vehicles in the world. This movie just doesn't work. 

### XX: *How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World* | ★

Boring.

### XX: *Dumbo* | ★

Outside of *Ed Wood*, none of Tim Burton's movies speak to me. This one didn't either. 

### XX: *Godzilla: King of Monsters* | ★

Big, dumb, boring. No stakes, no relateable characters, no cool Godzilla stuff. 

### XX: *The Lion King* | ★

The original cartoon was already good. Remaking it with realistic CGI only detracted. This movie is so bad it even wastes Donald Glover.

## "Hey, this was just okay"

### XX: *Serenity* | ★★

Matthew McConaughey stars in this insane fever dream movie that has to be seen to be believed. I've had a lot of fun describing the plot to people. 

### XX: *Replicas* | ★★

A fine, if forgettable Keanu programmer. Bizarre ending. 

### XX: *Crawl* | ★★

Alright little horror flick about a woman and her father braving a hurricane and homicidal alligators. Really sells the storm. 

### XX: *Brightburn* | ★★

Bad execution of an interesting premise - what if the young Superman who falls to earth in Kansas was evil? How do you stop a serial killer with super-strength and heat vision?

### XX: *Destroyer* | ★★

I love director Karyn Kusama, but this is one of her least-interesting works.

### XX: *It: Chapter Two* | ★★

I do not understand how the *It* movies are so successful when they flub basic scares. At a certain point I just tuned out. 

### XX: *Jojo Rabbit* | ★★

Taika Waititi cashed in a big blank check after *Thor: Ragnarok* to make a movie that is mostly about... nothing. There's no deeper message here and no good jokes. 

### XX: *Burning* | ★★

Interesting Korean thriller focusing on class and gender. A bit slow for me.

### XX: *Midsommar* | ★★

As the world's number-one *Hereditary* fan, I was disappointed by Ari Aster's new project. *Midsommar*'s emotional journey doesn't quite get there, and there's little good horror content. 

### XX: *Alita: Battle Angel* | ★★

Not the best franchise movie, but you can catch glimpses of what the filmmakers were going for. Christoph Waltz has an anime-sized scythe. 

### XX: *Charlie's Angels* | ★★

Look, no one cares about my opinion on this movie. It was clearly not made for me, and that's fine! 

### XX: *The Hole in the Ground*

A small horror movie from Ireland. Toys with some interesting ideas but ultimately doesn't connect with any of them. 

### XX: *Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark* | ★★

Never saw the original, but this was a fun little horror romp. Not doing anything groundbreaking, but executes well enough. 

### XX: *Joker* | ★★

*Joker* has an effective take on its titular character - it makes him pathetic. We've never seen the Joker as a loser before, and it kind of works. Too bad its politics are incoherent. 

### XX: *Shazam!* | ★★★

A fine movie. Liked the ending. 

### XX: *Hobbes & Shaw* | ★★

As far as action movies go, this is alright. Not sure I'd ever watch it again.

### XX: *Ford v. Ferrari* | ★★

God, does this movie make cars and racing look sexy. Good Christian Bale performance. 

### XX: *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | ★★

I remain unconvinced Tom Holland is a good Spider-Man (stop throwing things!). *Far From Home* did, however, give us a great Crazy Gyllenhaal<sup>TM</sup> performance.

## The good ones

### XX: *Fast Color* | ★★★

No one saw this movie, which sucks, because *Fast Color* is a breath of fresh air. It follows three generations of black women all gifted with super powers that may save their dying world. The depictions of their powers are *gorgeous*.

### XX: *Gemini Man* | ★★★

I caught a screening of this in 120 FPS high framerate and it was fascinating. Ang Lee is doing work no one else in film will even try, and I love it. 

### XX: *Escape Room* | ★★★

A shockingly good little PG-13 horror movie. Good performances, good script - this one will surprise you. 

### XX: *Detective Pikachu* | ★★★

They nailed it. The creative team translated Pokemon to the big screen. There was so much room to *Phantom Menace* this and it's amazing they didn't.

### XX: *Knock Down the House* | ★★★

A touching portrait of people fighting their hardest to change the system. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shows why she is one of the Democratic Party's brightest rising stars. I would happily watch ten hours of her tearing into Joe Crowley's terrible mail ads. 

### XX: *Cold Pursuit* | ★★★

Liam Neeson left the public eye this year ([maybe for good reason](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/liam-neeson-revenge-story-apology)), but he left us a nice gift before he went. *Cold Pursuit* is a surprisingly funny satire of a typical Liam Neeson revenge movie. It's got a weird energy I liked. 

### XX: *Ad Astra* | ★★★

More like:

* *Dad Astra*
* *Sad Astra*
* That's all I got

Brad Pitt has never looked more weathered than he does in *Ad Astra*, a beautiful movie about men who have to launch themselves to the furthest reaches of the solar system to explore their feelings.

### XX: *Ready Or Not* | ★★★

*Ready Or Not* knows exactly what it is. It's a funny horror movie about crazy in-laws hunting a newlywed in a lethal game of hide-and-seek. This movie is as goofy as it is entertaining. 

### XX: *Happy Death Day 2U* | ★★★

I feel like I am the only person who remembers that 2019 gave us a sequel to *Happy Death Day*, a wonderful and funny horror movie that should be mandatory viewing for the country. *2U* amps up the action by taking things in a more emotionally grounded direction. Even if it apparently worked for no one else, I liked it.

### XX: *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* | ★★★

Tarantino's turned in another love letter to classic Hollywood and the films of his youth. *OUTH* is obsessed with fame (specifically movie stardom), and what people will do to get or keep it. It's also an interesting examination of artists getting old and being baffled by the culture changing around them - something Quentin Tarantino might relate to. 

### XX: *The Lighthouse* | ★★★

Director Robert Eggers returns for a second movie after giving us *The Witch*, an excellent period horror flick. *The Lighthouse* is less horror and more... well, it's hard to describe. It is undeniably the movie Eggers intended to make.

### XX: *Avengers: Endgame* | ★★★

This is it. The culmination of a decade-plus of Marvel movies. The ending of this movie is pure fan payoff and I loved every second. There has never and may never be anything like this again. 

### XX: *Knives Out* | ★★★

The best trick of director Rian Johnson (*The Last Jedi*) in *Knives Out* is his inversion of genre tropes. These kinds of movies—*Clue*, *And Then There Were None*—usually focus on ensemble cast of variously villainous white characters, any of which could have done it, you get it.

*Knives Out* shines because it places Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), the Latina nurse, at the center. You wouldn't know it from the marketing, but this is her heroic journey. 

It's a full-course acting role for Armas, who delivers everything asked of her. In a movie about horrible people, she provides vital emotional grounding.

## Great effin' movies

### XX: *High Life* | ★★★★

*High Life* is fascinating. Though it might seem austere at first, look long enough and you see endless depth.

French arthouse director Claire Denis has given us the dingiest sci-fi film since *Alien*. *High Life* loves dust, decay, grime and death. It revels in how things fall apart, and how just a few times they maybe sort of come back together. 

Plus, it features André 3000 giving a great naturalistic performance. Put this man in more movies!

### XX: *Glass* | ★★★★

Most people hated M. Night Shymalan's *Glass* when it came out in January. Most people are wrong. 

*Glass* is a hyper-ambitious movie, attempting to (and mostly succeeding at) melding genres and offering a meta-commentary on superhero movies. It understands why we like comic books, and it has a few things to say about that. 

### XX: *Booksmart* | ★★★★

Look, *Booksmart* rules. That's all there is to this. Olivia Wilde's directorial debut is smart and funny as hell. Two nerdy teenage girls realize they've missed the fun of their high school years and embark on One Crazy Night.

*Booksmart* fires on all cylinders. The writing is stellar, the jokes all land and the performances are hilarious.

What makes *Booksmart* special, though, is its humanistic, kind worldview. No one in this movie is a bad guy or a two-dimensional caricature. Everybody is somebody in *Booksmart*, and it makes the movie so much better.

### XX: *John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum* | ★★★★

The knife fight in the hallway left my jaw on the floor. John Wick takes on a group of assassins in a hallway with a case full of knives and the results are pure magic. These movies have always had good action scenes, but goddamn. 

Bad action movies use quick cuts and jumping around to hide that their stars aren't really doing the stunts. *John Wick 3* luxuriates in long, unbroken shots of Keanu Reeves. It doesn't want to hide a moment of its best-in-Hollywood fight choreography. 

These movies are just good. Bringing in Halle Berry? Who fights with attack dogs? Hell yes. 

### XX: *Parasite* | ★★★★

I can't tell you what *Parasite* is about. It's better for you to go into this movie as blind as possible. That's what I did and it was a *wild* ride learning what this movie is actually about. 

All I'll tell you is director Bong-Joon Ho also made *Snowpiercer* and won a ton of awards for *Parasite* and you should see it. 

## Amazing, must-see films

### XX: *The Farewell* | ★★★★★

*The Farewell* is an absolutely stupendous film.

Awkwafina stars as Billi, a Chinese-American woman who goes to China to see her Nai Nai (grandmother). The family has not told Nai Nai she (Nai Nai) has terminal cancer, and this could be everyone's last chance to see her. 

Like many great movies, *The Farewell* at once specific and universal. Director Lulu Wang mines her own past to deliver a beautifully human story about the lies we tell each other to be happy. 

That sounds serious, and it is, but I promise *The Farewell* is funny. It bursts with lightness, bouncing you from great joke to great joke. Everything is a good time until you realize that now you care about Nai Nai too and oh god. 

*The Farewell* a wonderful movie, and I am thankful to have seen it.

### XX: *Us* | ★★★★★

The film critic David Rees once said, "All great movies are either puzzles or dreams." That is to say, some movies can be figured out, and some movies can't.

*Us* is a creation of pure nightmare logic. Everything is incomprehensible and makes perfect sense. It is a movie that exists beyond literal plot and more as an exploration of our fucked-up psyche. 

No movie has fascinated me in 2019 like *Us*. While I did not love it at first, Jordan Peele's masterpiece offers endless depths to those willing to plumb it. Do the Tethered represent America's underclass? Is Peele saying true equality in America is only possible by violent uprising? Is Adelaide the only competent upper-world person because she understands everything she has could be taken away in a moment? Is Peele saying this country has forgotten the violence used to gain its wealth? Is Peele saying wealth inherently requires violence?

*Us* cannot be solved, but god I love trying. 

The movie works beyond ideology and symbolism. Everyone in the family, especially Winston Duke, turns in a good performance. The performances outside the family are good as well - Madison Curry's scary face is one of the most disconcerting things I've ever seen.

(apologies for the poor quality screencap - in the theater her face wasn't compressed)

The highlight, of course, is Lupita Nyong'o. Her dual performances as Adelaide and Red are both phenomenal. She flawlessly embodies Adelaide's fears in a naturalistic way... and also gives a big, terrifying performance as Red.

I could probably write forever about *Us*, so I'll just say this. If you see it, see it twice. If you've already seen it, watch it again. The second time is better. 

*Us* is a stone-cold masterpiece. I love it.
