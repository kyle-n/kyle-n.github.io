### Background

After spending a few years [working in news](./about-me.html), I got the chance to pursue my real passion, developing great software. 

I love everything about software engineering: planning a project, developing new features, shipping a tough user story, even fixing bugs. 

I love learning new tools as well. I keep busy outside work teaching myself new concepts and new areas of programming. 

### My promise

I am a smart, dedicated, fast developer who is passionate about making great software.

I will work hard and learn from anyone I can to improve. I hope to hear from you!
